                                <p>Leukemia is a broad term for all types of cancers of the blood cells, including the
                                    cancers of the bone marrow cells and the lymphatic system. According to Globocan
                                    2018, the worldwide incidence rate of leukemia in 2018 was 3.2 per 100,000
                                    population. In India, about 42,055 new cases of leukemia were reported in 2018.</p>

                                <h3>About acute leukemia</h3>
                                <p>Acute leukemia refers to the rapidly progressing cancer that originates in the
                                    blood-forming tissues. This cancer causes the production of a large number of
                                    abnormal white blood cells; these cells are immature and non-functional and crowd
                                    out the mature, functional cells. Based on the type of white blood cells affected,
                                    acute leukemia can be classified as acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and acute
                                    lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). In children, AML attributes to about 20% of all
                                    leukemias, and ALL accounts for 80% of leukemia cases.</p> <br>
                                <p>Acute myelocytic/ myeloid/ myelogenous/ granulocytic/ non-lymphocytic leukemia (AML)
                                    is the cancer of the bone marrow (spongy tissue inside the blood, which produces
                                    blood cells) and blood. This cancer affects a type of white blood cell called
                                    myeloid cells. Normally, myeloid cells develop into different types of mature cells,
                                    like white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. In AML, the affected bone
                                    marrow produces a large number of these cells, which do not mature and hence, cannot
                                    fight infection.</p><br>
                                <p>Acute lymphocytic/ lymphoblastic/ lymphoid leukemia (ALL) also begins in the bone
                                    marrow and affects the lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells that produce
                                    antibodies, kill tumor cells and control immune responses. In ALL, too many immature
                                    lymphocytes are produced, which cannot fight infection. ALL is more common among
                                    children, and treatments have a success rate, but this is not the case in adults.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>Causes / Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>Acute leukemia may be caused by damage to the DNA of developing cells in the bone
                                    marrow. But it is not clear what causes these changes in the DNA. However, some risk
                                    factors can lead to ALL or AML, some of them are discussed below:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Age:</b> The risk of AML increases with age; it mostly occurs in adults older than
                                    65 years. But ALL is likely to occur in children and adults older than 50 years.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Gender:</b> Males are more likely to develop AML and ALL than females.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Exposure to radiation and chemicals:</b> Being exposed to high levels of
                                    radiation, like surviving a nuclear reactor accident, increases the risk of
                                    developing ALL as well as AML. Exposure to chemicals like benzene is associated with
                                    an increased risk of AML.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Previous cancer treatment:</b> Individuals who have undergone chemotherapy and
                                    radiation therapy for other cancers are at a higher risk of both ALL and AML.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Genetic disorders:</b> Some genetic disorders, such as Down’s syndrome, are linked
                                    with a greater risk of ALL and AML.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Blood disorders:</b> Blood disorders, such as myelofibrosis, myelodysplasia,
                                    thrombocythemia, or polycythemia vera, are associated with an increased risk of AML.

                                <p><b>Having a sibling or identical twin with ALL:</b> Individuals who have a sibling or
                                    an identical twin who has been diagnosed with ALL are at an increased risk of this
                                    cancer.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Smoking:</b> Both ALL and AML are associated with cigarette smoking.</p><br>
                                <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                                <p>The symptoms of acute leukemia may vary based on the type of blood cell affected.
                                    However, most of the signs and Acute Myeloid Leukemia Symptoms of AML and ALL are
                                    similar, which include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Fever</li>
                                    <li>Lethargy and fatigue</li>
                                    <li>Bone pain</li>
                                    <li>Pale skin</li>
                                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                                    <li>Frequent infections</li>
                                    <li>Frequent nosebleeds</li>
                                    <li>Bleeding from the gums</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>But symptoms, such as easy bruising indicates AML, whereas lumps caused by swollen
                                    lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, abdomen, or groin are symptoms of ALL.</p><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>If any type of acute leukemia is suspected, the following diagnostic tests may be
                                    recommended:5</p><br>
                                <p><b>Blood tests:</b> Individuals with ALL or AML, usually have a large number of white
                                    blood cells, and fewer red blood cells and platelets. Immature cells present in bone
                                    marrow but not moving in the blood, also indicate AML or ALL.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Bone marrow test (BMT):</b> A BMT is performed to confirm the diagnosis of
                                    leukemia. In this test, a sample of bone marrow is taken using a needle. Usually,
                                    the sample is taken from the hip bone or the breastbone, and sometimes from other
                                    bones. Laboratory analysis will help determine the origin of cancer and specific
                                    type of cancer, depending on the size, shape, and genetic or molecular features,
                                    essential for treatment planning.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Genomic testing:</b> Genomic testing can help determine the genetic mutations,
                                    specific genes, chromosomal changes, and other features unique to the patient’s
                                    leukemia. This can help predict the prognosis and plan the treatment approach.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Lumbar puncture (or spinal tap):</b> In this test, a small needle is inserted into
                                    the lower back into the spinal canal to obtain a sample of spinal fluid (the fluid
                                    that surrounds the brain and spinal cord). This test determines whether the leukemia
                                    cells have spread to the spinal fluid.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Lymph node biopsy:</b> This test is done to diagnose other lymphomas and is rarely
                                    recommended for ALL patients, as the diagnosis is made with blood and bone marrow
                                    tests. In this test, a sample of the lymph node is removed through an incision,
                                    under local anesthesia. However, general anesthesia may be needed if the lymph node
                                    is in the deeper tissues of the body.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Imaging tests:</b> Imaging tests such as CT scan, X-ray, MRI scan or ultrasound
                                    scan can help examine if cancer has spread to other parts of the body.</p><br>
                                <h3>Staging/ Subtypes of AML and ALL</h3>
                                <p>AML and ALL are not staged like other types of solid tumors. These cancers are
                                    usually spread across the bone marrow and sometimes to other organs, by the time it
                                    is diagnosed. Hence, the prognosis of the patient depends on the subtype of AML or
                                    ALL, the patient’s age, and other laboratory test results.</p><br>
                                <p>Knowing the subtype of ALL or AML is essential to planning the treatment and
                                    obtaining the best possible outcomes.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>AML</b> is classified as follows, according to the World Health Organization

                                    <li><b>AML</b>not otherwise specified</li>
                                    <li>Myeloid sarcoma (or granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma)</li>
                                    <li>Myeloid proliferations related to Down syndrome</li>
                                    <li>Undifferentiated and biphenotypic acute leukemias (have both lymphocytic and
                                        myeloid features)</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>The WHO system divides ALL into several groups:</p><br>
                                <h3>B-cell ALL</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>B-cell ALL with certain genetic abnormalities (gene or chromosome changes)</li>
                                    <li>B-cell ALL, not otherwise specified</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>T-cell ALL</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Early T-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Mixed lineage acute leukemias</h3>
                                <p>This group has both lymphocytic and myeloid features in the same or different cells.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>The treatment of ALL and AML depends on various factors, like subtypes of cancer,
                                    age, the overall health of the patient, and their preferences.</p><br>
                                <p>In general, treatment of AML can be categorized into two phases:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Remission induction therapy:</b> This phase aims to kill the leukemia cells in the
                                    blood and bone. Usually, in this phase all the leukemia cells are not wiped out,
                                    hence further treatment will be required to prevent cancer recurrence.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Consolidation therapy (maintenance therapy, post-remission therapy, or
                                        intensification):</b> This treatment phase aims to destroy the remaining
                                    leukemia cells and reduce the risk of relapse.</p><br>
                                <p>Along with these two phases, ALL treatment is categorized into two more phases:</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Maintenance therapy:</b> This phase prevents leukemia cells from re-growing. In
                                    this phase, the treatment is provided at much lower doses over a long period.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Preventive treatment to the spinal cord:</b> During each treatment phase, ALL
                                    patients may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells in the central
                                    nervous system. For this, usually, chemotherapy drugs are directly injected into the
                                    spinal fluid.</p><br>
                                <p>Following are the therapies used for the treatment of AML and ALL:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> It involves giving drugs to kill the cancer cells in the body.
                                    These drugs are administered either intravenously or given orally in cycles. This
                                    therapy can be given as an induction therapy for children (in case of ALL) and
                                    adults, as well as the consolidation and maintenance phases. Patients with AML may
                                    have to stay in the hospital while receiving chemotherapy, as the drugs destroy
                                    several normal cells, causing undesirable effects.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Targeted therapy:</b> This therapy uses drugs that target the specific
                                    abnormalities of the cancer cells, which help them grow. This therapy may be
                                    combined with or given after chemotherapy.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b> Radiation therapy involves delivering high-powered beams,
                                    such as protons or X-rays, to kill cancer cells. This therapy is recommended when
                                    the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Bone marrow transplant (or stem cell transplant):</b> In this treatment, the
                                    unhealthy bone marrow is surgically replaced with leukemia-free stem cells, that
                                    would produce healthy bone marrow. This transplant is performed after giving high
                                    doses of radiation therapy or chemotherapy to destroy the leukemia-producing bone
                                    marrow. This treatment approach may be used as consolidation therapy.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                                <p>Currently, there is no definite way to prevent leukemia, as most individuals with
                                    acute leukemia do not have known risk factors. However, quitting smoking offers a
                                    chance to reduce an individual’s risk of AML. Cancer-causing chemicals, such as
                                    benzene must be avoided, which can lower the risk of AML.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                                <p>The chance of recovering from ALL and AML depends on several factors, including
                                    mutations, patient’s age, general health, a subtype of leukemia, response to
                                    treatment, etc. However, the survival rate of AML is about 28.3% and ALL is about
                                    68.60%. An early diagnosis and proper treatment tend to improve the outlook.</p><br>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/bonecancer.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                                <p>Bone cancers and sarcomas are rare and heterogeneous groups of tumors that arise
                                    predominantly from the connective tissues. Globally, they account for less than 1%
                                    of all cancers. These cancers usually affect children and young adults more than the
                                    older population. According to the National Cancer Registry Programme of the India
                                    Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the incidence of bone cancer is below 2 % of all
                                    cancers among the Indian population, while sarcomas are the fifth most common solid
                                    tumors in children, and account for about 6-7% of all childhood malignancies.</p>

                                <h3>Bones and Soft tissues</h3>
                                <p>Bones are the supporting framework of our body which facilitates movement, protection
                                    of internal organs, and hematopoiesis (formation of blood cellular components). Soft
                                    tissues are the extra-skeletal tissues of the body that surround organs and other
                                    anatomic structures like tendons, the lining of the joints, muscles, fats, and blood
                                    vessels.</p><br>
                                <p>Sarcoma and bone cancers arise from the embryonic mesenchymal cells that mature into
                                    muscles, adipose tissue, bone, and cartilage among other tissues.</p><br>
                                <h3>Bone Cancer</h3>
                                <p>Bone cancer develops when the healthy cells in the bone grow uncontrollably and form
                                    a mass called a tumor. As the tumor develops, abnormal cells crowd out the healthy
                                    ones. These tumors weaken the bone and make it vulnerable to fracture. The tumors
                                    can be malignant (cancerous, spread to other parts of the body) or benign
                                    (non-cancerous, do not spread to nearby tissues).</p><br>
                                <h3>Types of bone cancer</h3>
                                <p>There are mainly two types of bone cancer:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Primary bone cancer</b>- cancer that starts in the bone.</li>
                                    <li>b
                                        Secondary bone cancer- cancer that starts in another part of the body and
                                        spreads to the bone (metastatic bone cancer).</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <p>Primary cancers are the true bone cancers; the different kinds of primary bone
                                    cancers are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Osteosarcoma:</b> Originates from the bone-forming cells called osteoblasts
                                        in the osteoid tissue (immature bone tissue). They occur most often in the arms,
                                        legs, and pelvis.</li>
                                    <li><b>Chondrosarcoma:</b> Originates in the cartilage and mainly affects the
                                        pelvis, legs, and arms. Middle-aged and older adults are more likely to develop
                                        this cancer.</li>
                                    <li><b>Ewing's sarcoma:</b> Occur mostly in the bones of the pelvis, legs, or ribs.
                                        These are aggressive and spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Chordoma:</b> Usually seen in the spine and base of the skull. They tend to
                                        grow slowly and rarely spread to other parts of the body.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Bone marrow cancer symptoms and signs:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dull aching pain that worsens at night and with activity</li>
                                    <li>Joint swelling and stiffness</li>
                                    <li>Limping</li>
                                    <li>Bone fracture</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <p>Other less common bone cancer symptoms are fever, a feeling of being unwell,
                                    unintentional weight loss, and anemia (low level of red blood cells).</p><br>
                                <h3>Causes and Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>The exact cause of the bone tumors is unknown. Researchers believe that bone cancer
                                    may develop due to sudden changes in the cells of the bone. Additionally, some
                                    factors may increase the risk of bone cancer, and include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A prior history of other cancers like breast, lung, prostate, kidney, or thyroid
                                        cancer</li>
                                    <li>Paget's disease (a noncancerous bone condition)</li>
                                    <li>Injury to a bone causing chronic infection</li>
                                    <li>Some inherited conditions such as retinoblastoma (eye cancer that begins in the
                                        retina), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (inherited familial disorder)</li>
                                    <li>History of radiation therapy</li>
                                    <li>Exposure to certain chemicals</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>If any sign or symptom in a patient raises the suspicion of bone cancer, the
                                    following tests are recommended:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Blood tests:</b> The presence of certain markers such as alkaline phosphatase
                                        and lactate dehydrogenase in the blood indicates cancer.</li>
                                    <li><b>Imaging studies:</b> These tests help to determine the location, size of bone
                                        tumors, and the extent of the tumor, and include:</li>
                                    <li><b>X-ray:</b> X-rays create pictures of the dense structures like bones inside
                                        the body. Cancer may make the bone appear different from a healthy bone on an
                                        X-ray.</li>
                                    <li><b>Bone scan:</b> This uses radioactive tracers to view the insides of the
                                        bones. These traces get accumulated in areas of the bone and show the changes or
                                        abnormalities in the bones.</li>
                                    <li><b>Other imaging studies:</b> In some cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
                                        computerized tomography (CT), or positron emission tomography (PET) scans are
                                        performed to help evaluate the tumor further.</li>
                                    <li><b>Biopsy:</b> A biopsy involves collecting a sample of tissue from the
                                        suspected area and examining it in the laboratory to determine any
                                        abnormalities. A needle biopsy or incisional biopsy is performed depending on
                                        the location of the tumor.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Stages of bone cancer</h3>
                                <p>The cancer staging is done followed the TNM staging system. It provides detailed
                                    information about:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Tumour (T):</b> Size and extent of tumor</li>
                                    <li><b>Node (N):</b> Whether cancer has spread to the surrounding lymph nodes</li>
                                    <li><b>Metastasis (M):</b> Whether cancer has spread to distant parts of the body
                                    </li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Based on TNM staging, bone cancer can be in any of the following stages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Stage I:</b> The cancer is low-grade and is either smaller or larger than
                                        8cm. The tumor is limited to the bone and has not spread to the surrounding
                                        tissue of the bone.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage II:</b> The cancer is medium or high-grade and is either smaller or
                                        larger than 8cm. It has not spread to the surrounding tissue of the bone.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage III:</b> The cancer is medium or high-grade and is found in more than
                                        one place on the same bone. It has not spread to any lymph node or other parts
                                        of the body.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IV:</b> Cancer cells are of any size or grade and have spread to the
                                        lymph nodes and distant parts of the body like the brain, liver, or lungs.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Treatment options for bone cancer usually depend on several factors, including the
                                    type, stage of cancer, possible side effects, and the overall health of the patient.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>Treatment modalities available for bone cancer are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Surgery:</b> Surgery is an appropriate treatment option for all types of bone
                                        cancer. It involves the removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy
                                        tissues. The common types of surgeries include:</li>
                                    <li><b>Limb salvage surgery:</b> In this method, the cancerous section of the bone
                                        is removed while leaving the nearby muscles, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels
                                        intact.</li>
                                    <li><b>Amputation:</b> In this method, a part of the entire affected limb (arm or
                                        leg) is removed.</li>
                                    <li><b>Cryosurgery:</b> It is a type of ablation to destroy the cancerous tissues
                                        using cold temperature. During the procedure, a very cold metal probe is placed
                                        directly on the site of the tumor to kill the abnormal cells.</li>
                                    <li><b>Chemotherapy:</b> It involves the use of drugs to destroy rapidly growing
                                        cancer cells in the body. These drugs interfere with the process of cell
                                        division and promote cancer cell death. For bone cancer, chemotherapy is
                                        administered along with radiation therapy or after surgical procedures to
                                        enhance its effect. It is an important part of treatment for osteosarcoma and
                                        Ewing’s sarcoma.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Some side effects of chemotherapy are nausea, hair loss, weight loss, and extreme
                                    fatigue.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation Therapy:</b> It involves using high-energy beams like X-rays, gamma
                                    rays, and electron beams to shrink and destroy tumors. For bone cancer, radiation
                                    therapy can be given alone or in combination with chemotherapy or after surgery to
                                    ease the symptoms and prevent the recurrence of cancer.</p><br>
                                <p>Side effects from radiation therapy may include mild skin reactions, fatigue, nausea
                                    and vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Targeted Therapy:</b> This therapy involves the use of drugs that interfere with
                                    genes or proteins that contribute to the growth and survival of cancer cells,
                                    thereby destroying the cancer cells. These are different from chemo drugs and have
                                    minimal side effects.</p><br>
                                <h3>SARCOMAS</h3>
                                <p>A sarcoma occurs when healthy cells in the soft tissues and other locations undergo a
                                    change and start to grow out of control, which slowly forms a mass or lump called a
                                    tumor. The tumors can be benign (non-cancerous, do not spread to nearby tissues) or
                                    malignant (cancerous, spread to other parts of the body).</p><br>
                                <p>The tumors that originate within the soft tissues are called primary cancers while
                                    those cancers that start in another part of the body and spread to the soft tissues
                                    are called secondary tumors.</p><br>
                                <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Sarcomas are usually asymptomatic during the early stage. As the sarcomas originate
                                    in different locations, the signs and symptoms vary depending on the location of the
                                    tumor. A lump or swelling which may or may not cause pain is usually the first sign
                                    of sarcoma.</p><br>
                                <p>Other possible osteosarcoma symptoms include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Abdominal pain that worsens</li>
                                    <li>Blood in stool or vomit</li>
                                    <li>Bone fracture and pain</li>
                                    <li>Skin lesions</li>
                                    <li>Abnormal vaginal bleeding</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Bone Cancer Causes and Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>The exact cause of soft tissue sarcoma is not clear. Generally, errors in the DNA
                                    cause the cell to divide at an uncontrollable rate, forming tumors.</p><br>
                                <h3>Other risk factors that can increase the risk of sarcoma include:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Specific inherited disorders such as Von Recklinghausen’s disease, Li-Fraumeni
                                        syndrome, or retinoblastoma</li>
                                    <li>Being exposed to the chemicals</li>
                                    <li>History of radiation therapy</li>
                                    <li>Having a weak immune system</li>
                                    <li>Damaged lymph system( lymphedema)</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>There are no screening tests that can detect sarcomas in their early stages. If a
                                    person experiences any possible sign or symptom of sarcoma, the following tests are
                                    recommended.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Imaging tests:</b> Tests such as computerized tomography (CT), magnetic
                                        resonance imaging (MRI) scan, chest X-ray, bone scan, and angiography are done
                                        to examine any suspicious area to learn how far cancer may have spread.</li>
                                    <li><b>Biopsy:</b> Biopsy can help make a definite diagnosis of sarcoma. It involves
                                        the removal of some tumor tissues from the suspicious area using a needle guided
                                        by CT or MRI scanning. The sample is analyzed under a microscope to determine if
                                        it is cancerous or benign.</li>
                                    <li><b>Tissue testing of the tumor:</b> These laboratory tests will help to identify
                                        specific genes, proteins, and other factors unique to the tumor.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Stages of sarcoma</h3>
                                <p>Sarcomas are also staged based on the TNM staging system. Based on this system, the
                                    sarcomas can be in the following stages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Stage I:</b> The cancer is low-grade and is either less than or larger than 5
                                        cm across. It has not spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage II:</b> The cancer is medium or high-grade and is either 5 cm or larger
                                        than 5 cm across. It has not spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the
                                        body.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage III:</b> The cancer is high-grade and larger than 5 cm across and has
                                        not spread to the lymph nodes, OR the cancer is of any size or grade, but it has
                                        spread to the lymph nodes and not to other parts of the body.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IV:</b> The cancer is any size or grade and may have spread to the
                                        lymph nodes and distant parts of the body like the lungs and liver.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Bone Cancer Treatment</h3>
                                <p>The treatment method for soft tissue cancer is based on the location, type, and stage
                                    of sarcoma, possible side effects, and overall health of the patient. The major
                                    treatment modalities include:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Surgery:</b> Surgery is the mainstay and involves the surgical removal of the
                                    entire tumor. In rare cases, where the tumor is large and involves major blood
                                    vessels and nerves, the whole tumor is removed to control its spread (amputation).
                                    This is common in arms and limbs.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b> Radiation therapy may be used before the surgery
                                    (neoadjuvant therapy) to shrink the tumor or after the surgery (adjuvant therapy) to
                                    destroy any remaining cancer cells.</p><br>
                                <p>Radiations can be given through an external machine or can be delivered by placing a
                                    radiation source near the site of the tumor (internally). In some cases,
                                    intraoperative radiation is performed during surgery to protect the nearby healthy
                                    tissues.</p><br>
                                <p>Common side effects of radiation therapy include fatigue, headaches, memory loss, and
                                    scalp irritation.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to destroy rapidly growing
                                    cancer cells in the body. Chemo drugs are injected into a vein (IV) or given orally.
                                    For sarcomas, chemotherapy is given as the main treatment or after the surgical
                                    procedures to enhance its effect.</p><br>
                                <p>Common side effects of chemotherapy include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and hair loss.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>Targeted therapy: It involves the use of specific drugs to identify and destroy the
                                    specific cancer cells without harming the normal cells. The targeted drugs work
                                    differently from standard chemo drugs and offer minimal side effects.</p><br>
                                <h3>Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Although there is no way to prevent bone cancer and sarcomas, early diagnosis and
                                    timely treatment can help improve mortality and morbidity. For those with a known
                                    risk factor, a regular checkup can help in the early detection of cancer. Patients
                                    with early-stage tumors have the best chance of long-term survival. Once the active
                                    treatment is completed, regular checkups and medications are needed to manage the
                                    side effects and maintain overall well-being.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/cervicalcancer.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Cervix cancer is one of the top gynecologic cancers worldwide. According to current
                                    data, it is fourth-ranked cancer among women that results in over 3,00,000 deaths
                                    worldwide. It is mainly caused by certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV).</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Research showed that 90% of cervical cancers occur in low-income and middle-income
                                    countries that fail to organize proper screening and HPV vaccination programs. As
                                    per Globocan 2018, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Indian
                                    women.</p><br>
                                <h3>About cervical cancer</h3>
                                <p>The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects the vagina (birth canal) and
                                    uterus. It acts as a passage for menstrual blood and secretes mucus to lubricate the
                                    female reproductive tract.</p><br>
                                <p>Cervical cancer occurs when the normal cells of the cervix undergo mutations and
                                    begin to grow out of control. These abnormal changes in the cells can initially lead
                                    to a pre-cancerous stage. In some cases, these pre-cancerous cells of the cervix
                                    turn into invasive cancers that may spread to other parts of the body and can be
                                    fatal.</p><br>
                                <h3>Types of cervical cancer:</h3>
                                <p>The main types of cervical cancers are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Squamous cell carcinoma: It accounts for 85 to 90 percent of cervical cancers.
                                        This cancer begins in the squamous cell lining the outer part of the cervix
                                        (exocervix).</li>
                                    <li> Adenocarcinomas: These cancers develop from glandular cells of the endocervix
                                        (the cervical opening that leads to the uterus).</li>
                                    <li> Adenosquamous carcinomas: These cancers are rare and have features of both
                                        squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas.</li>
                                </ul><br>

                                <ul>
                                    <li> Unusual bleeding, such as in between periods, after sex, or after menopause
                                    </li>
                                    <li> An unusual discharge from the vagina</li>
                                    <li> Pain in the pelvic region</li>
                                    <li> Pain during sexual intercourse</li>
                                    <li> Pain during urination</li>

                                <p>Advanced stage cervical cancer may cause the following symptoms:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Swelling of the legs</li>
                                    <li> Problem while urinating or during a bowel movement</li>
                                    <li> Blood in the urine</li>

                                <h3>Causes/ Risk Factors</h3>
                                <p>Most cervical cancers are caused by <b>human papillomavirus (HPV)</b>. However, not
                                    all HPV infections lead to cervical cancer.</p><br>
                                <p>HPV viruses are usually transmitted between people through skin-to-skin contact. It
                                    can be passed through sexual contact and can affect cells on the surface of the
                                    mucus membrane lining the genitals, anus, mouth, and throat. They manifest with
                                    visible warts on the genitals or surrounding skin.</p><br>
                                <p>Factors that might increase the risk of cervical cancer include the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Exposure to the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) while in the mother's womb</li>
                                    <li>Having three or more children</li>
                                    <li>Smoking</li>
                                    <li>Oral contraceptive use for a long time</li>
                                    <li>Multiple sexual partners</li>
                                    <li>A weak immune system</li>
                                    <li>Past or current history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</li>
                                    <li>Sexual activity and/or pregnancy at a young age</li>
                                    <li>Family history of cervical cancer</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Regular screening is the only way to detect cervical cancer. Cervical screening can
                                    be done by HPV test and the Pap test.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>HPV test:</b> This test involves collecting and examining cells from the
                                        cervix to identify the HPV strains that are most likely to cause cervical
                                        cancer.</li>
                                    <li><b>Pap test:</b> This test involves inserting a brush or spatula inside the
                                        cervix to collect a sample of cells from the cervix. The sample is examined in a
                                        laboratory to check for any abnormalities.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Some more tests are recommended if the results of the HPV test and Pap test are
                                    abnormal. Initially, the signs and symptoms, medical history, and family history of
                                    the patient are reviewed. A complete physical examination is performed to evaluate
                                    the overall health of the patient followed by a detailed pelvic examination. If
                                    cervical cancer is suspected, a colposcopy may be scheduled.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Colposcopy: In this procedure, a small colposcope (a thin flexible tube with a
                                        video camera at the end) is inserted through the wall of the vagina. The camera
                                        would then transmit the real-time images of the vagina and cervix on the
                                        monitor. During the colposcopic examination, the doctor may perform a cervical
                                        biopsy for a detailed diagnosis.</li>
                                    <li>Biopsy: It is performed along with colposcopy. The procedure involves inserting
                                        special tools through the colposcope to collect the sample of tissue. These
                                        tissues are further examined in the laboratory to check for any abnormalities.
                                    </li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Stages of cervical cancer</h3>
                                <p>The staging for cervical cancer includes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Stage I:</b> The cells have grown from the surface of the cervix into deeper
                                        tissues of the cervix. It has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant sites.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Stage II:</b> Cancer has spread beyond the cervix and uterus, but is still
                                        inside the pelvic area. It has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant
                                        sites.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage III:</b> Cancer has spread to the lower third of the vagina, and/or has
                                        spread to the pelvic wall. It may cause kidney problems and involves regional
                                        lymph nodes.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IV:</b> Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the
                                        lungs.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Cervical Cancer Treatment</h3>
                                <p>The following modalities of cervical cancer treatment by stage are recommended:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Surgery:</b> It is the mainstay of treatment for cervical cancer. Depending
                                        upon the
                                        size and stage of cancer, the surgeon may recommend any of the following
                                        surgeries:</li>
                                    <li> <b>Cryosurgery:</b> It is a type of ablation to destroy the cancerous cervical
                                        tissues
                                        at cold temperatures. During the procedure, a very cold metal probe is placed
                                        directly on the cervix to kill the abnormal cells by freezing them.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Laser ablation:</b> It is a type of ablation method that uses a laser beam
                                        to
                                        destroy cancerous tissues. It is performed under local anesthesia. In this
                                        procedure, an intense laser beam is passed through the vagina to vaporize
                                        abnormal cells.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Conization:</b> It is recommended both as a diagnostic tool and treatment
                                        modality.
                                        Here, a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal is
                                        removed.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Hysterectomy:</b> It is recommended during early-stage cervical cancer. This
                                        procedure involves the removal of the cervix and uterus. Hysterectomy can either
                                        be simple or radical. A simple hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus
                                        and cervix while a radical hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus,
                                        cervix, upper vagina, and the tissue around the cervix.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Trachelectomy:</b> It involves the removal of the whole cervix to completely
                                        remove
                                        cancer.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Radiation therapy:</b> It involves the usage of high-energy X-ray beams to
                                        kill cancer cells. Depending on the stage, radiation therapy can be given alone
                                        or combined with chemotherapy for cervical cancer or might be administered after
                                        the surgery. Radiation therapy can be given externally through an external
                                        machine or it can be delivered internally by placing a radiation source near the
                                        vagina or cervix.</li>
                                    <li><b>Chemotherapy:</b> It involves the use of drugs to kill or stop the growth of
                                        cancer cells. The drugs are usually taken orally or injected into the vein or
                                        muscles. Chemotherapy is administered in combination with radiation therapy for
                                        cervical cancer to enhance its effect.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Common drugs used for chemotherapy include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Carboplatin</li>
                                    <li>Cisplatin</li>
                                    <li>Paclitaxel</li>
                                    <li>Fluorouracil</li>
                                    <li>Cyclophosphamide</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b>Targeted therapy:</b> It involves the use of specific drugs or other substances to
                                    identify and destroy the cancer cells without harming the normal cells. Drugs
                                    approved for the treatment of cervical cancer include bevacizumab.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Immunotherapy:</b> It involves the use of certain medicines to boost a person’s
                                    immune system to find and destroy the cancer cells. It is used to treat
                                    advanced-stage cervical cancer and to prevent its recurrence. The drug approved for
                                    the treatment of cervical cancer is pembrolizumab.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prevention of cervical cancer</h3>
                                <p>In addition to getting screened regularly and receiving HPV vaccination follow these
                                    steps to prevent cervical cancer:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Delaying first sexual intercourse until the late teens or older</li>
                                    <li>Avoiding sexual intercourse with multiple partners</li>
                                    <li>Practicing safe sex by using condoms</li>
                                    <li>Smoking cessation</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable and treatable cancers. When diagnosed
                                    at an early stage, the five-year cervical cancer survival rate is 92%, while it
                                    drops to 56% when diagnosed at an advanced stage. Additionally, routine screening
                                    and HPV vaccination improve the cervical cancer prognosis of women. Cancer diagnosed
                                    at late stages can also be controlled with appropriate treatment and palliative
                                    care.</p>

                                <p>Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer among women worldwide and the 15th
                                    most common cancer, in general. In 2018, over 382,069 new cases were recorded and
                                    89,929 deaths attributed to endometrial cancer worldwide.</p><br>
                                <p>Moreover, it is the second most common gynecological cancer and is considered the
                                    fourth leading cause of death. The worldwide incidence rate for endometrial cancer
                                    is rapidly increasing, and it is estimated to increase by more than 50% by 2040.</p>

                                <p>Uncontrolled growth of cells in the innermost lining of the uterus (endometrium) is
                                    known as uterine/endometrial cancer. It refers to cancer that starts in the uterus
                                    and is different from the cancer of the uterine muscle (sarcoma). It is the most
                                    common type of cancer in the uterus. About 2-3% of women may develop it in their
                                    lifetime, especially during post-menopause.</p><br>

                                <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Early detection of endometrial cancer improves the chances of successful treatment.
                                    The majority of women with endometrial cancer have an abnormal bleeding that helps
                                    in early detection. However, in certain cases, endometrial cancers may progress into
                                    an advanced stage before causing signs and symptoms.</p><br>
                                <p>The symptoms of endometrial cancer may include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods or after menopause</li>
                                    <li>Abnormal vaginal discharge</li>
                                    <li>Pelvic pain or feeling a mass</li>
                                    <li>Painful urination</li>
                                    <li>Pain during sexual intercourse</li>
                                    <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>

                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Any symptoms related to endometrial cancer, such as abnormal vaginal bleeding should
                                    be informed to the doctor right away, as early diagnosis can improve cancer
                                    outcomes. Following are the tests involved in the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.
                                </p><br>
                                <p><b>Medical history:</b> The patient’s medical history related to past illnesses and
                                    treatments are obtained. Details about the patient’s general health, risk factors
                                    (if any), and specific signs related to endometrial cancer are analyzed.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Physical examination:</b> Physical examination includes a pelvic exam, where the
                                    abnormalities in the uterus and cervix, are assessed for.</p><br>
                                <p>Other tests and procedures used to diagnose endometrial cancer include:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Ultrasound:</b> During the transvaginal ultrasound, a probe is inserted into the
                                    vagina, which creates images of the uterus using high-energy sound. It helps in the
                                    treatment of thickened endometrium to analyze texture. It also enables checking for
                                    the presence of abnormalities related to the uterine lining and tumors.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Hysteroscopy:</b> During hysteroscopy, a thin flexible tube with a light source,
                                    known as a hysteroscope is inserted into the vagina. It helps to examine the uterus
                                    and endometrium for abnormalities. Sometimes, an endometrial biopsy can also be
                                    performed during hysteroscopy, where a small tissue sample is obtained from the
                                    endometrium and sent for histological analysis. Local anesthesia may be given before
                                    the procedure to reduce pain or discomfort during the procedure.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Dilation & curettage (D&C):</b> D&C is recommended when the sample procured during
                                    the endometrial biopsy is insufficient or if the biopsy results are unclear. D&C is
                                    usually performed as an outpatient procedure under local or general anesthesia.
                                    During the procedure, the opening of the cervix is dilated (widened) and a curette
                                    (spoon-shaped instrument) is used to scrape the tissue from the lining of the uterus
                                    and examined it under the microscope for abnormal cells.
                                    The histological studies help to confirm the diagnosis and provide details about the
                                    grade and type of endometrial cancer. When the cancer is suspected to have advanced
                                    to other body parts, further tests may be recommended that involve determining the
                                    extent of spread and cancer stage. They may include chest x-ray, computed tomography
                                    (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET).</p>

                                <h3>Endometrial cancer staging</h3>
                                <p>Depending on the size and spread of the tumor, endometrial cancer is classified into
                                    four stages.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Stage I uterine cancer:</b> The cancer is confined to the uterus.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage II:</b> Cancer has spread to the cervix, but not outside the uterus.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Stage III:</b> Cancer has spread outside the uterus and cervix, but not
                                        beyond the pelvis. It might spread to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, vagina,
                                        ligaments of the uterus, and nearby lymph nodes.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IV:</b> Cancer has spread beyond the pelvis into the bladder, bowel,
                                        and/or other distant parts of the body.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>The treatment plan and the long-term outlook depend on the cancer stage. Endometrial
                                    cancer is often diagnosed at an earlier stage due to persistent abnormal bleeding.
                                    With early diagnosis and prompt medical intervention, endometrial cancer can be
                                    treated easily with better outcomes.</p><br>
                                <p>The common types of treatments for endometrial cancer include:</p>br
                                <h3>Endometrial Surgery</h3>
                                <p>Surgery is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. It involves removing the
                                    uterus and other affected areas.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Total hysterectomy:</b> Total hysterectomy involves removing the uterus along with
                                    the cervix. The surgery can be performed through the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy),
                                    large incision in the abdomen (total abdominal hysterectomy), or through a small
                                    incision in the abdomen (total laparoscopic hysterectomy).</p><br>
                                <p><b>Radical hysterectomy:</b> It involves the surgery to remove the entire uterus
                                    along with the immediate ligaments (parametrium and uterosacral ligaments) and the
                                    upper part of the vagina.</p><br>
                                <p>Surgeries that may be performed along with hysterectomy include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Salpingo-oophorectomy:</b> It is a surgery to either remove one ovary and
                                        fallopian tube (unilateral) or both ovaries and both fallopian tubes
                                        (bilateral).</li>
                                    <li><b>Lymphadenectomy:</b> It is a surgery to remove one or more lymph nodes from
                                        the pelvic region and evaluate it for the presence of cancer.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Radiation therapy for endometrial cancer</h3>
                                <p>Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to destroy the cancer cells and can be
                                    delivered from outside the patient’s body, known as external beam radiation therapy.
                                    When the radiation is delivered through a radioactive source placed inside the
                                    vagina, it is called brachytherapy.</p><br>
                                <p>In some cases, radiation therapy may be recommended to reduce the chances of cancer
                                    recurrence after the surgery. It may also be administered before the surgery to
                                    shrink the tumor, enabling easy removal. Radiation therapy alone is also used as the
                                    treatment for patients who cannot undergo surgery.</p><br>
                                <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
                                <p>Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells. Many chemotherapy drugs
                                    are available and often they are given in combinations. It can be received orally or
                                    intravenously, where the drugs enter the bloodstream and reach the cancer cells to
                                    destroy them (systemic chemotherapy). The drugs can also be placed directly in the
                                    body cavity to target the cancer cells in the affected area (regional chemotherapy).
                                    Sometimes, chemotherapy may be recommended after the surgery to decrease the risk of
                                    cancer recurrence or to shrink the size of the tumor before surgery. It is often
                                    used to treat advanced or recurrent endometrial cancers.</p><br>
                                <h3>Hormone therapy</h3>
                                <p>Hormone therapy involves changing the levels of certain hormones in the body. This
                                    could impact the cancer cells that depend on such hormones for their growth, thereby
                                    arresting their growth. During endometrial cancer, the hormones affected are
                                    estrogen and progesterone and the drugs that control these hormones help the cancer
                                    cells to shrink and die.</p><br>
                                <h3>Targeted therapy</h3>
                                <p>Targeted therapy uses certain drugs to specifically identify and target cancer cells,
                                    without affecting normal cells. Monoclonal antibodies, mTOR inhibitors, and signal
                                    transduction inhibitors are three types of targeted therapy used to treat
                                    endometrial cancer. Often, targeted therapy is used in combination with chemotherapy
                                    to treat advanced endometrial cancers.</p><br>
                                <h3>Immunotherapy</h3>
                                <p>Immunotherapy helps boost the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. It
                                    can be used to treat endometrial cancers that have spread to other parts or when
                                    other treatments fail to confer protection.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                                <p>Endometrial cancer is not preventable; however, certain measures may help to reduce
                                    the risk. They include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Maintaining a healthy weight</li>
                                    <li>Being physically active</li>
                                    <li>Using birth control pills</li>
                                    <li>Discussing with the doctor the risks of hormone therapy after menopause</li>
                                    <li>Obtaining appropriate treatment for endometrial problems</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                                <p>The prognosis of endometrial cancer depends on its type and stage. However, the
                                    prognosis for endometrial cancer is usually good due to early diagnosis, as it often
                                    leads to abnormal vaginal bleeding. The majority of women with endometrial cancer
                                    are successfully cured with surgery. The over20-year year survival rate is about 80%
                                    and the five-year year survival rate ranges from 74% to 91%. Recurrences are usually
                                    expected within the first three years after treatment.</p>

                                <p>Liver and gallbladder cancer is a common and aggressive malignancy of the hepatic
                                    biliary system. Liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality and is
                                    ranked the sixth most diagnosed cancer worldwide. However, gallbladder cancer is
                                    rare and accounts for 1.2% of all cancer diagnoses globally. The incidence of these
                                    cancers is increasing and there is a higher prevalence in developing countries.</p>

                                <h3>About Liver and Gallbladder</h3>
                                <p>The liver and gallbladder are two accessory organs of the gastrointestinal tract. The
                                    liver is located under the diaphragm in the upper right portion of the abdomen. It
                                    aids in digestion and hemostasis. The liver secretes bile - a yellowish-green fluid
                                    that emulsifies fats. The excess bile is stored in a small sac-shaped organ – the
                                    gallbladder which is located below the liver. The liver and gallbladder are
                                    interconnected by ducts. When the cells in the liver or gallbladder undergo DNA
                                    changes (mutations), it may cause abnormal cell growth, leading to cancers.</p><br>
                                <h3>Liver cancer</h3>
                                <p>Liver cancer (or hepatic cancer) arises when the healthy cells in the liver undergo
                                    mutations in their DNA and grow out of control to form a mass or sheet of cells
                                    called a tumor. These tumors can be malignant (cancerous, spread to other parts of
                                    the body) or benign (non-cancerous, do not spread to nearby tissues).</p><br>
                                <h3>Types of liver cancer</h3>
                                <p>Liver cancer can be classified into two:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Primary cancer begins in the tissue of the liver.</li>
                                    <li>Secondary cancer also known as metastatic cancer begins in other parts of the
                                        body and spread to the liver. Metastatic tumors are more common than primary
                                        tumors.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Liver cancer in the early stage generally has no signs or symptoms. As cancer grows
                                    and spreads to nearby tissue the following symptoms can be observed:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Enlarged liver and spleen</li>
                                    <li>Painful or painless hard lump under ribs on the right side of the body</li>
                                    <li>Yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice)</li>
                                    <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
                                    <li>Nausea</li>
                                    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                                    <li>Upper abdominal pain</li>
                                    <li>Bloating</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Causes/Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>The precise cause of liver cancer is not known. However, certain factors can increase
                                    the risk of developing liver cancer. These include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Long-term hepatitis B or C infection</li>
                                    <li>Cirrhosis and long-term alcohol abuse</li>
                                    <li>Exposure to carcinogens</li>
                                    <li>History of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</li>
                                    <li>Smoking</li>
                                    <li>Obesity</li>
                                    <li>Type-II diabetes</li>
                                    <li>Increased intake of anabolic steroids</li>
                                    <li>A family history of other liver diseases</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>If a person experiences any signs or symptoms of liver cancer, the following tests
                                    may be recommended:</p><br>
                                <p><b>A Blood tests:</b> These tests help to diagnose liver function abnormalities.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Liver function tests:</b> These tests check for abnormal levels of proteins,
                                        liver enzymes, and bilirubin in the blood.</li>
                                    <li><b>Serum marker test:</b> Markers are proteins secreted by cancer cells, whose
                                        presence in blood indicates cancer. An elevated level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
                                        in blood indicates liver cancer.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <p><b>Imaging tests:</b> Tests such as ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scan,
                                    and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide detailed information about the size and
                                    spread of cancer. An angiogram is performed to examine the blood vessels that supply
                                    blood to the tumor.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Biopsy:</b> It involves the removal of tumor tissues using specialized needles for
                                    detailed examination. It is the most reliable way to determine cancer.</p><br>
                                <h3>Stages</h3>
                                <p>The liver cancer staging is done using the TNM staging system. It provides detailed
                                    information about:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Tumour (T):</b> Whether the primary tumor has grown through the liver</li>
                                    <li><b>Node (N):</b> Whether cancer has spread to the surrounding lymph nodes</li>
                                    <li><b>Metastasis (M):</b> Whether cancer has spread to distant parts of the body
                                    </li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Based on this system, liver cancer stages are as follows:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Stage I:</b> Single tumor confined to the liver and has not spread to nearby
                                        lymph nodes or distant sites.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage II:</b> Either a single tumor larger than 2cm that has spread to blood
                                        vessels OR several small tumors that all remain in the liver</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage III:</b> More than one tumor confined to the liver, with one tumor
                                        larger than 5 cm OR one tumor that has spread to a major branch of a large vein
                                        of the liver</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IV Liver Cancer:</b> Single tumor or multiple tumors that have spread
                                        to distant parts of the body like bones, lungs</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Liver Cancer Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Once liver cancer is diagnosed, a customized treatment plan is created based on the
                                    stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis and the overall health of the liver.
                                    Treatments for liver cancer include:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Surgery:</b> The tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue are removed by surgical
                                    procedures. Surgery improves the chance of recovery for patients with early-stage
                                    liver cancer. Surgical approaches include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Partial hepatectomy:</b> This involves the removal of a portion of the liver,
                                        ranging from a smaller wedge to an entire lobe. It is recommended for stage I
                                        cancer.</li>
                                    <li><b>Liver transplantation:</b> This involves removal of the whole liver and
                                        replacing it with a healthy one from an organ donor. It is an option for those
                                        tumors that cannot be removed with surgery.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <p>Possible side effects are bleeding, infections, blood clots, and rejection of new
                                    liver.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Ablation therapy:</b> This therapy involves non-surgical methods to destroy the
                                    tumors without removing them and is recommended for the elderly or patients with
                                    serious conditions, where surgery cannot be considered. The procedure involves
                                    placing a needle or probe directly into the liver tumor to destroy them. Based on
                                    the methods used to destroy the cancer cells, it is classified into:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Radiofrequency ablation</li>
                                    <li>Percutaneous ethanol (alcohol) ablation</li>
                                    <li>Cryotherapy</li>
                                    <li>Microwave ablation</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b>Embolization Therapy:</b> Embolization is a procedure in which certain substances
                                    are injected directly into the blood vessels in the liver to block or reduce the
                                    blood flow to a tumor in the liver. Sometimes, the procedure is combined with
                                    chemotherapy (called chemoembolization) or radiation (radioembolization) for better
                                    outcomes.</p><br>
                                <p>Possible complications after the procedure are abdominal pain, fever, nausea, liver
                                    infections, and blood clots in the main blood vessels.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Targeted therapy:</b> This therapy uses drugs that interfere with genes or
                                    proteins that contribute to the growth and survival of cancer, and thereby destroy
                                    the cancer cells. These are different from chemo drugs and have minimal side
                                    effects.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> It involves the use of specific oral or intravenous drugs to
                                    kill cancer cells. It is recommended for patients who cannot undergo surgery or have
                                    not responded to local therapies or targeted therapy. Chemotherapy is usually given
                                    in cycles and the patient may receive a single or a combination of drugs.</p><br>
                                <p>Common side effects include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hair loss,
                                    and diarrhea.4</p><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b>  High-energy radiations like X-rays are used to destroy
                                    tumor cells. It is not considered for patients with severe liver damage due to
                                    hepatitis or cirrhosis.</p><br>
                                <p>For liver cancer, stereotactic body radiation therapy is used. This method delivers
                                    high doses of radiation to a tumor while limiting the amount of radiation to nearby
                                    healthy tissue.</p><br>
                                <p>Major side effects may include mild skin reactions, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea
                                    and vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Immunotherapy:</b> This uses drugs that direct the body’s immune system to kill
                                    cancer cells. For liver cancer, drugs like atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab,
                                    and ipilimumab are used to attack cancer cells by boosting the natural defense of
                                    the immune system.</p><br>
                                <h3>Gallbladder Cancer</h3>
                                <p>Gallbladder cancer occurs when healthy cells in the gallbladder undergo change and
                                    start to grow out of control, which slowly forms a tissue mass or lump called a
                                    tumor. The tumors can be benign (non-cancerous, do not spread to nearby tissues) or
                                    malignant (cancerous, spread to other parts of the body).</p><br>
                                <p>The majority of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinomas - cancer that starts in the
                                    tissue on the inside wall of the gallbladder. Less common types of gallbladder
                                    cancer are adenosquamous carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and carcinosarcomas.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
                                <p>There are no specific symptoms for gallbladder cancer in its early stage. Symptoms
                                    usually appear in the advanced stage when the tumor is large and/or has spread.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Common symptoms of gallbladder cancer include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Abdominal pain and cramps</li>

                                    <li>Fever</li>
                                    <li>Unintentional weight loss</li>
                                    <li>Nausea</li>
                                    <li>Yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)</li>
                                    <li>Itchy skin</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Liver Cancer Causes/Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>Like other cancers, the exact cause of gallbladder cancer is not clear. Some factors
                                    that may increase the risk of gallbladder cancer are:</p>
                                <ul>

                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>There are no early screening tests used for gallbladder cancer. If a person
                                    experiences any signs or symptoms of gallbladder cancer, the following tests are
                                    recommended.</p><br>
                                <h3>Blood tests:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p><b>Liver and gallbladder function test:</b> Elevated levels of bilirubin in
                                            the blood indicate gallbladder cancer due to blockage of the common bile
                                            duct by a tumor.</p><br>
                                        <p><b>Tumor marker:</b> Tumor markers are proteins secreted by cancer cells,
                                            whose presence in the blood indicates cancer. Gallbladder cancer patients
                                            have high CA19-9 or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in their blood.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Imaging tests:</b> Tests such as ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT)
                                        scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are done to examine the suspicious
                                        area to learn how far cancer may have spread.</li>
                                    <li><b>Laparoscopy:</b> In this procedure, a small laparoscope (thin flexible tube
                                        with a mounted video camera) is inserted through the abdomen. The camera
                                        transmits real-time images of the bladder to examine the structures and signs of
                                        disease.</li>
                                    <li><b>Biopsy:</b> It involves the removal of some tumor tissues from the suspicious
                                        area using a needle. The sample is analyzed under a microscope to determine if
                                        it is cancerous or benign. The procedure is guided by CT or MRI scanning.</li>

                                <h3>Stages</h3>
                                <p>Gallbladder cancer is also staged based on the TNM staging system. Based on this
                                    system, cancer has the following stages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Stage I:</b> Cancer cells are confined to the gallbladder and have not spread
                                        to distant sites.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage II:</b> Cancer cells have extended to the peri-muscular connective
                                        tissue but have not spread to distant sites.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage III:</b> Cancer cells have either spread beyond the gallbladder and
                                        have not spread to lymph nodes or are present in the gallbladder and have spread
                                        to lymph nodes. </li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IV:</b> Cancer cells have either spread to nearby blood vessels or
                                        lymph nodes and have not spread to distant sites, or have spread to distant
                                        parts of the body like bones, and lungs.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Treatment approaches for gallbladder cancer depend on the stage of cancer at the time
                                    of diagnosis, possible side effects, and the overall health of the patient. The main
                                    types of treatments for gallbladder cancer are:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Surgery:</b> It involves the surgical removal of the entire tumor. Surgery is the
                                    mainstay of early and advanced cancers for easing the symptoms of advanced cancer.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>Types of surgery:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Cholecystectomy:</b> It involves the removal of the gallbladder. It is
                                        recommended for stage I cancer.</li>
                                    <li><b>Radical gallbladder resection:</b> In this procedure, the gallbladder along
                                        with a wedge-shaped section of the liver, the bile duct, and lymph nodes are
                                        removed.</li>
                                    <li><b>Palliative surgery:</b> It is performed to ease the symptoms and
                                        complications of cancer such as blockage of the bile ducts. It is recommended
                                        for stage IV cancer.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b> Radiation therapy may be used before surgery
                                    (neoadjuvant therapy) to shrink the tumor or after surgery (adjuvant therapy) to
                                    destroy any remaining cancer cells. For advanced cancers, it is also used to ease
                                    the symptoms (palliative therapy).</p><br>
                                <p>For gallbladder cancer, high-energy beams are delivered to the site of the tumor
                                    through an external source (external beam therapy). It is an outpatient procedure
                                    that is usually given over several weeks.</p><br>
                                <p>Side effects from radiation therapy may include mild skin reactions, fatigue, loss of
                                    appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> It involves the use of specific anticancer drugs to destroy the
                                    cancer cells. In gallbladder cancer, chemo drugs are used as:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A part of the main treatment for some advanced cancers</li>
                                    <li>An adjuvant treatment after surgery to reduce the recurrence of cancer</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Common side effects of chemotherapy are fatigue, nausea and vomiting, loss of
                                    appetite, hair loss, and diarrhea.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Immunotherapy:</b> It involves the use of medications that boost the patient’s
                                    immune system to recognize the cancer cells and destroy them. Most of the
                                    immunotherapy drugs for gallbladder cancer are in clinical trials.</p><br>
                                <h3>Outlook:</h3>
                                <p>Although there is no way to prevent liver and gallbladder cancers, early diagnosis
                                    and prompt treatment may reduce the risk of cancer. Patients with early-stage tumors
                                    have the best chance of long-term survival. Unfortunately, most liver and
                                    gallbladder cancers are diagnosed in the advanced stages. Follow-up care and staying
                                    positive throughout the treatment will help obtain better outcomes.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/myelodysplasticsyndromes.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Myelodysplastic syndrome is an umbrella term for a group of bone marrow disorders,
                                    where the blood cells (immature) in the bone marrow do not mature properly or
                                    develop as healthy blood cells. It is estimated that the annual incidence of
                                    myelodysplastic syndromes is about 4.9 cases for every 100,000 people.</p><br>
                                <h3>Brief overview</h3>
                                <p>The bone marrow is a soft spongy tissue found in most bones. It produces immature
                                    cells known as stem cells that can differentiate into three kinds of blood cells-
                                    red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The fully developed, mature, and
                                    functional blood cells leave bone marrow to enter the bloodstream. In
                                    myelodysplastic syndrome, the stem cells in the bone marrow may not mature or they
                                    may turn out as damaged or defective blood cells. Hence, individuals with
                                    myelodysplastic syndrome have immature or fewer circulating blood cells in their
                                    bodies.</p><br>
                                <p>Based on the number of blood cells affected and many other factors, myelodysplastic
                                    syndromes are categorized into several types. However, in about one in three
                                    patients, the myelodysplastic syndrome may progress to become an aggressive cancer
                                    of the bone marrow cells known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</p><br>
                                <p>Myelodysplastic Syndrome Types</p><br>
                                <p>Depending on the type of blood cells involved, myelodysplastic syndromes are divided
                                    into the following subtypes.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Myelodysplastic syndrome with unilinear dysplasia</b> - One blood cell type is low
                                    in number and appears abnormal under the microscope</p><br>
                                <p><b>Myelodysplastic syndrome with multilineage dysplasia</b> - Two or three blood cell
                                    types are abnormal, with low numbers of at least 2 types of blood cell types.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Myelodysplastic syndrome with ringed sideroblasts</b> - Red blood cells in the
                                    bone marrow contain a ring of excess iron around the nucleus known as ring
                                    sideroblasts. The white blood cell and platelet counts are usually normal.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Myelodysplastic syndrome associated with isolated del chromosome abnormality</b> -
                                    Low numbers of red blood cells with a specific mutation (deletion of 5q chromosome)
                                    in their DNA.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts</b> - Any of the three types of blood
                                    cells may be low and appear abnormal under a microscope. Very immature blood cells
                                    are observed in the blood and bone marrow.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Myelodysplastic syndrome, unclassified</b> - Reduced numbers of one of the three
                                    types of mature blood cells, with no specific signs of the other MDS subtypes.
                                    Either the white blood cells or platelets may look abnormal under a microscope.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Causes and risk factors of myelodysplastic syndromes</h3>
                                <p>In most cases, the cause of the myelodysplastic syndromes remains unknown. However
                                    certain factors can increase the chance of developing myelodysplastic syndromes.
                                    They include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Receiving cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy</li>
                                    <li>Exposure to toxic chemicals, such as tobacco, benzene, and pesticides</li>
                                    <li>Exposure to heavy metals, such as lead or mercury</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Typically, myelodysplastic syndromes are more common for people aged around 75 years.
                                    Also, men are more likely to develop this condition compared to women.</p><br>
                                Signs And Myelodysplastic Syndrome Symptoms
                                <p>Typically, patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome at its earlier stage, may not
                                    experience any symptoms. However, there are two common features found in
                                    myelodysplastic syndrome patients. Firstly, they have a low blood cell count for at
                                    least one type of blood cell. Secondly, the blood cells in their bone marrow and
                                    blood look abnormal in shape or size.</p><br>
                                <p>The symptoms if they do occur may include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                                    <li>Unusual paleness because of anemia (low red blood cell count)</li>
                                    <li>Easy bruising or bleeding due to thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Pinpoint-sized red spots under the skin caused by bleeding (petechiae)</li>
                                    <li>Frequent infections attributable to leukopenia (low white blood cell count) 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Diagnosis for myelodysplastic syndromes could be difficult as the symptoms are not
                                    specific for the condition and are common to many other conditions. Also, there are
                                    no specific tests that indicate the presence of the condition. Hence, several types
                                    of tests are performed to rule out other conditions and create a treatment plan.

                                <h3>Medical History</h3>
                                <p>A detailed medical history may be obtained along with information related to past
                                    exposure to harmful chemicals or cancer treatments such as radiation therapy or
                                    chemotherapy. </p><br>
                                <h3>Blood Tests</h3>
                                <p>Several types of blood tests are used to determine the number of blood cells and to
                                    find out any abnormalities related to their shape, size, and appearance.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Complete Blood Count (CBC):</b> CBC is a basic test that is used to check whether
                                    the numbers of various blood cell types fall within the reference ranges. Any
                                    abnormalities in this test could be implied as to the first sign of the condition.
                                    Following any suspicious results, a blood smear test may be advised, which involves
                                    examining the cells under the microscope for the presence of dysplasia (abnormal
                                    growth of the cells).</p><br>
                                <p>Blood tests that measure other components such as iron, erythropoietin, vitamin B12,
                                    and folates help to rule out other conditions and determine the exact cause of the
                                    disease.</p><br>
                                <h3>Bone Marrow Tests</h3>
                                <p>A bone marrow test is a mainstay for the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes.
                                    During the procedure, the liquid bone marrow is obtained from the pelvic or
                                    breastbone using a hollow needle, in a process known as bone marrow aspiration.
                                    Subsequently, a solid piece of the bone marrow is also removed, in a process known
                                    as bone marrow biopsy. The samples obtained are tested in many ways to diagnose the
                                    condition, monitor the response to treatment, and provide information about the
                                    prognosis of the condition. Listed are the tests performed on the bone marrow
                                    samples.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Histochemistry studies:</b> During the histological analysis, the cells are
                                        examined under the microscope to look for any abnormalities related to
                                        myelodysplastic syndromes. They also help to determine the bone marrow blast
                                        (immature blood cell) count and to find other causes for bone marrow
                                        malfunction.</li>
                                    <li><b>Cytogenetic studies:</b> These studies help determine changes in the
                                        structure of the chromosome in the bone marrow cells sampled. About 50% of
                                        people with myelodysplastic syndromes have one or more chromosomal changes, most
                                        of them seen in the chromosomes 5, 7, 8, and 20.</li>
                                    <li><b>Flow cytometry:</b> During flow cytometry, the sampled cells are passed
                                        through a laser beam that enables to effectively look for dysplasia and estimate
                                        the blast count.</li>
                                    <li><b>Molecular testing:</b> Molecular studies are more precise in that look for
                                        DNA mutations in the cells. These tests determine the specific genetic
                                        characteristics of bone marrow cells.</li>

                                <h3>Myelodysplastic syndromes staging</h3>
                                <p>According to the French American British (FAB) system, the different stages of
                                    myelodysplastic syndromes include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Refractory anemia - Blasts less than 5%</li>
                                    <li>Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts – Blasts less than 5%</li>
                                    <li>Refractory anemia with excess blasts in transmission (Acute myelogenous
                                        leukemia) - Blasts 5-20%</li>
                                    <li>Refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation - Blasts 21-30%</li>
                                    <li>Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia - Blasts 5-20%</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Myelodysplastic Syndrome Treatment</h3>
                                <p>The treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome predominantly involves managing the
                                    symptoms and slowing the disease progression. People with no symptoms are monitored
                                    regularly to see if the disease progresses.</p><br>
                                <h3>Blood transfusions</h3>
                                <p>Blood transfusions may be used to replace red blood cells, white blood cells, or
                                    platelets. They help to treat symptoms like anemia, fatigue, and shortness of breath
                                    in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.</p><br>
                                <h3>Medications</h3>
                                <p>The common medications used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes include:
                                </p><br>
                                <p><b>Growth factors</b> – These help promote blood cell production and reduce the need
                                    for blood transfusions.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy</b> – This therapy helps kill the abnormal cells of the bone marrow
                                    and bring back its ability to produce functional blood cells. It also helps to
                                    reduce the risk of acute myeloid leukemia.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Immune modulators</b> – These agents suppress the myelodysplastic syndrome cells
                                    and also alter the immune system. It works well for mild myelodysplastic syndrome
                                    and in people with deletion of the 5q chromosome.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Immune suppressants</b> – These drugs are used to suppress the immune system and
                                    reduce the need for red blood transfusions.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Antibiotics</b> - Infections are frequent complications in patients with
                                    myelodysplastic syndrome either due to low blood counts or immune therapies. Hence,
                                    antibiotics may be recommended to treat infections.</p><br>
                                <h3>Bone marrow transplant</h3>
                                <p>A bone marrow transplant (stem cell transplant) is often a curative treatment for
                                    myelodysplastic syndromes, where the patient receives new stem cells that can grow
                                    into healthy blood cells in the bone marrow. During the procedure, high doses of
                                    chemotherapy are used to kill the defective blood cells in the bone marrow and then
                                    are replaced with healthy cells obtained from a donor (allogeneic transplant).</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                                <p>The prognosis is determined based on the results obtained from diagnostic tests. The
                                    blood counts, percentage of immature blood cells (blast cells) in the bone marrow,
                                    and the types of chromosomal abnormalities together affect the prognosis of the
                                    condition. The average survival for a patient with a mild disease at the time of
                                    diagnosis could be around 5.7 years, and 0.4 years for a patient with severe
                                    disease.</p><br>

                                <p>Pancreatic cancer refers to carcinoma that develops in the cells of the pancreas. It
                                    is ranked as the 12th most common cancer and is responsible for 7% of all
                                    cancer-related deaths in both men and women. As the patients seldom exhibit specific
                                    signs and symptoms until the advanced stage of the disease, it ranks as the
                                    7th highest cause of cancer mortality in the world. The global prevalence rate of
                                    pancreatic carcinoma is 1 per 100, 000 people per year.</p><br>
                                <h3>About pancreatic cancer</h3>
                                <p>The pancreas is a long, flat gland located in the abdomen behind the stomach. It
                                    plays a crucial role in the digestive as well as the endocrine system. Generally,
                                    there are two kinds of cells in the pancreas– exocrine cells and neuroendocrine
                                    cells. Exocrine cells produce digestive enzymes while neuroendocrine cells produce
                                    several hormones, including insulin and glucagon.</p><br>
                                <p>Pancreatic carcinomas arise when cells in the pancreas begin to grow and divide at an
                                    uncontrollable rate and form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign (do not
                                    invade nearby tissues) or malignant (spread to other parts of the body).</p><br>
                                <h3>Types of pancreatic cancer</h3>
                                <p>As the pancreas is made of endocrine and exocrine cells, each type of these cells can
                                    give rise to a different type of tumor.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Exocrine tumors, the most common type of pancreatic cancer, develop from the
                                        cells that line the ducts which deliver enzymes to the small intestine (exocrine
                                        cells). About 95% of cancers of the exocrine region are
                                        pancreatic adenocarcinomas.</li>
                                    <li> Neuroendocrine tumors are less common pancreatic cancer that arises from the
                                        endocrine cells. They often grow slower than the exocrine tumors and account for
                                        about 7% of all pancreatic tumors.</li>
                                </ul> <br>

                                <p> Pancreatic cancers often do not cause any signs or symptoms until it reaches the
                                    advanced stages of the disease.</p><br>

                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose as there may not be any
                                    noticeable signs or symptoms. The following tests are recommended for an accurate
                                    pancreatic cancer diagnosis if suspected of it:</p><br>
                                <p><b> Imaging tests:</b> Tests such as computerized tomography (CT) scan,
                                    ultrasound, MRI, and PET scan are done to examine the suspicious area to learn
                                    how far cancer may have spread. Tests like angiography and
                                    cholangiopancreatography are performed to visualize the blood vessels and
                                    pancreatic ducts, respectively.</p><br>
                                <p> <b>Blood test:</b> Blood tests help to detect proteins known as tumor markers
                                    secreted by pancreatic cancer cells</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Liver function tests:</b> These tests check for abnormal levels of
                                        bilirubin and other substances and determine the exact cause of
                                        jaundice.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Tumor marker test:</b> Tumor markers are proteins that are secreted
                                        by cancer cells, whose presence in blood indicates cancer. Tumor markers
                                        that may indicate pancreatic cancer are CA 19-9 and carcinoembryonic
                                        antigen (CEA).</li>
                                    <li> <b>Complete blood count (CBC):</b> This test will evaluate the general
                                        health condition of the patients.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p> <b>Biopsy:</b> Biopsy involves inserting a specialized needle device guided by
                                    radio-imaging to remove a small amount of tumor tissue for detailed examination.
                                    There are mainly three types of biopsy based on the mode of insertion of the
                                    needle: percutaneous (through the skin) biopsy, endoscopic biopsy, and surgical
                                    biopsy.</p><br>
                                <h3>Stages of pancreatic cancer</h3>
                                <p>The cancer staging is done using the TNM staging system. It provides detailed
                                    information about:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Tumour (T):</b> Whether the primary tumor has grown through the pancreas
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <b>Node (N):</b> Whether cancer has spread to the surrounding lymph nodes</li>
                                    <li> <b>Metastasis (M):</b> Whether cancer has spread to distant parts of the body

                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Based on the TNM staging, pancreatic cancer can be in any of the following stages:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Stage 0a/0is:</b> Cancer cells are located on the surface of the pancreatic
                                        duct cells.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage I:</b> Cancers are confined to the pancreas and are less than 4 cm in
                                        diameter.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage II:</b> Cancer cells have either spread beyond the pancreas and have
                                        not spread to lymph nodes, or are confined to the pancreas but have spread to
                                        lymph nodes. </li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage III:</b> Cancer cells have spread beyond the pancreas and involve
                                        either the celiac artery or superior mesenteric artery and/or cancer has spread
                                        to nearby lymph nodes.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage IV:</b> Cancer has spread from the pancreas to distant parts of the
                                        body like bone, lungs, liver, or bones.</li>

                                <p>If you have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, your cancer care team will discuss
                                    your treatment options and their possible risk and benefits.</p><br>
                                <p>Treatment modalities available for pancreatic cancer are:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Surgery:</b>  Pancreas surgery is an appropriate treatment option for all
                                    pancreatic cancers as it completely removes the cancer cells and also increases the
                                    chances of long-term survival. Laparoscopy is recommended before the pancreatic
                                    cancer surgery, to help determine the extent of cancer and to check whether it can
                                    be surgically removed.</p><br>
                                <p>Pancreatic surgery types to remove tumors include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Whipple procedure:</b> During this procedure, the head of the pancreas and
                                        sometimes, the nearby structures like part of the gallbladder, stomach, small
                                        intestine, and the bile duct, are removed. Part of the body and the tail of the
                                        pancreas is left behind to produce digestive juices and hormones. This, Whipple
                                        surgery costs few of the nearby digestive organs but curtails cancer.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Total pancreatectomy:</b> This procedure involves the removal of the entire
                                        pancreas, as well as the gallbladder, part of the stomach and small intestine,
                                        and the spleen. It is recommended for end-stage cancers. Patients who undergo
                                        this surgery must take hormonal and pancreatic enzyme supplements to maintain
                                        safe blood sugar levels and promote proper digestion.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Distal pancreatectomy:</b> In this surgery, the body and the tail of the
                                        pancreas are removed; the spleen may be removed if cancer has spread to the
                                        spleen.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>If the cancer is in advanced stages and cannot be removed, the following types
                                    of palliative (to improve quality of life) surgery may be recommended:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Biliary bypass:</b> Here, the gallbladder or bile duct is removed if the
                                        cancer is blocking the bile duct or the bile is building up in the gallbladder.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <b>Endoscopic stent placement:</b> In this surgery, a stent (a thin tube) is
                                        placed to drain the bile when the tumor is blocking the bile duct.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Gastric bypass:</b> If the tumor is blocking the flow of food from the
                                        stomach, the stomach can be sewn directly to the small intestine so the patient
                                        can continue to eat normally.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b> It involves using high-energy beams like X-rays, gamma
                                    rays, and electron beams to shrink and destroy tumors. For pancreatic cancers,
                                    radiation therapy can be scheduled after the surgical procedures to manage
                                    advanced-stage cancer and prevent the recurrence of cancer. Radiation therapy can be
                                    given externally through an external machine or it can be delivered internally by
                                    placing a radiation source near the site of the tumor.</p><br>
                                <p>The side effects of radiation therapy may include mild skin reactions, fatigue, loss
                                    of appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> It involves the use of drugs to kill or stop the growth of
                                    cancer cells.  The drugs are usually taken orally or injected into the vein or
                                    muscles. Pancreatic cancer chemotherapy is given with radiation therapy or after
                                    surgical procedures to enhance its effect.</p><br>
                                <p>Possible side effects of chemotherapy include nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite,
                                    hair loss, mouth sores, and diarrhea or constipation.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Targeted therapy:</b> It involves the use of specific drugs to identify and
                                    destroy the specific cancer cells without harming the normal cells. The targeted
                                    drugs work differently from standard chemo drugs and offer minimal side effects.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Immunotherapy:</b> Immunotherapy involves the use of substances derived from
                                    living organisms, which either recognize or attack cancer cells or boost the natural
                                    defense of the immune system. Immunotherapy can be used to treat pancreatic cancer
                                    is called checkpoint inhibitors. </p><br>
                                <p><b>Palliative care:</b> It involves specialized medical care that focuses on
                                    providing relief from pain using pain medications and other physical symptoms, such
                                    as digestive issues, nutritional deficiencies, etc. which occur particularly in the
                                    advanced stages of cancer. It also offers emotional support for stress, anxiety, and
                                    depression.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prevention:</h3>
                                <p>There is no definite way to prevent pancreatic cancer. However, some lifestyle
                                    changes and maintaining general well-being may reduce your risk. It includes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> quitting smoking</li>
                                    <li> keeping a healthy weight</li>
                                    <li> exercising regularly</li>
                                    <li> reducing alcohol consumption</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Outlook:</h3>
                                <p>Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose as it often fails to show symptoms until
                                    the advanced stages. Compared with many other cancers, the five-year survival rate
                                    for pancreatic cancer is very low at just 5-10%. Despite the overall poor pancreatic
                                    cancer prognosis, an early diagnosis and prompt treatment can ensure a better
                                    patient outcome.</p><br>

                                <p>Stomach (gastric) cancer remains a major health concern in many countries. Each year,
                                    over one million cases of stomach cancer are diagnosed around the world. It is the
                                    seventh most prevalent, and fifth most diagnosed cancer in the world. Likewise,
                                    esophageal cancer is the ninth most common cancer and the sixth most common cause of
                                    cancer deaths worldwide. However, the incidence rates may vary according to region

                                <p>Typically, stomach and esophageal cancers are slow-growing cancers, where the
                                    symptoms may not appear until the advanced stages. Stomach and esophageal cancers
                                    are more common in men compared to women. They can occur at any age but are more
                                    common in people aged over 60 years. Many factors may influence the development of
                                    cancer, which may include genetic, immunologic, infectious, and environmental

                                <p>The cancers that originate from the tissues of the stomach or esophagus are known as
                                    stomach or esophageal cancer. The esophagus and stomach are part of the upper
                                    gastrointestinal tract of the digestive system. The esophagus is a long, hollow tube
                                    that carries the food consumed, from the back of the throat to the stomach. The
                                    stomach is a muscular organ located on the left side of the upper abdomen. It holds
                                    food that enters the esophagus and initiates the digestion process by secreting
                                    acids and enzymes. The partly digested food enters the first part of the small
                                    intestine known as the duodenum.</p><br>

                                <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Stomach cancer symptoms and esophageal cancer symptoms, in their early stages, may
                                    not be observed. If the symptoms occur, they are common to many other conditions and
                                    as a result, the cancers are usually diagnosed at later stages. It is essential to
                                    seek medical advice if there is a concern or when the gastric cancer symptoms
                                    persist for a long time.</p><br>
                                <p>Stomach cancer may be associated with pain or a burning sensation in the stomach. It
                                    may cause abdominal discomfort and indigestion with frequent burping. People with
                                    stomach cancer may also experience persistent bloating. When cancer develops in the
                                    esophagus, it may lead to upper abdominal discomfort, especially while eating. It is
                                    also associated with difficult or painful swallowing and hoarseness. People with
                                    esophageal cancer may also experience pain in the throat, behind the breastbone, or
                                    between the shoulder blades.</p><br>
                                <p>Other symptoms that are common for both the cancers include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Heartburn</li>
                                    <li> Loss of appetite</li>
                                    <li> Unintentional weight loss</li>
                                    <li> Fatigue</li>
                                    <li> Nausea and vomiting</li>
                                    <li> Blood in vomit</li>
                                    <li> Black or tarry stools</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Several tests and procedures may be used in the diagnosis of stomach and esophageal
                                    cancers. The common tests may include:</p><br>
                                <p><b> Medical history and physical exam:</b> The medical history includes information
                                    about the gastric cancer symptoms such as pain, bloating, and difficulty eating.
                                    Information related to the possible risk factors is also obtained. Physical
                                    examination may be performed to examine the abdomen for abnormalities and other
                                    information related to general health.</p><br>
                                <p>Barium swallow test: A barium study is performed to examine the upper part of the
                                    digestive system such as the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. During this study,
                                    the patient is asked to swallow a fluid containing barium that coats the inside of
                                    the organs and reveals any abnormalities present in the tissue on the X-ray.</p><br>
                                <p>Endoscopy: During endoscopy, a long, flexible tube with a light and camera on the end
                                    (endoscope) is passed into the mouth, down to the throat through the esophagus, and
                                    into the stomach. It helps to visualize and identify the areas of irritation or
                                    abnormalities.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Biopsy:</b> If there are any suspicious findings during endoscopy, a special scope
                                    is used to collect a sample tissue for examination under a microscope.</p><br>
                                <p>Once the diagnosis of cancer is confirmed, further tests may be recommended to know
                                    if cancer has spread to the other parts of the body. This process is known as cancer
                                    staging, which helps to determine the treatment and prognosis. Such tests may
                                    include:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Endoscopic ultrasound:</b> During this test, an endoscope with an ultrasound probe
                                    on one end is inserted into the mouth, down to the throat through the esophagus, and
                                    into the stomach. The sound waves produced by the ultrasound probe helps to
                                    determine whether cancer has spread into the esophageal wall, nearby tissues, or
                                    lymph nodes.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Computed tomography (CT):</b> CT uses x-ray beams to create detailed
                                    cross-sectional images of the insides of the body. It is often used to evaluate the
                                    extent of the tumor spread to other parts of the body such as the chest, abdomen,
                                    and pelvis.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Positron emission tomography (PET):</b> A PET scan uses a special dye containing
                                    radioactive tracers that mainly adhere to the cancer cells. A special camera is used
                                    to create a picture of areas of radioactivity in the body. Sometimes, a PET scan is
                                    combined with a CT scan to provide more detailed and accurate information about
                                    cancer. </p><br>
                                <h3> Staging of the stomach and esophageal cancer</h3>
                                <p>Stages of the stomach and esophageal cancers include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Stage I:</b> Tumors are confined to the stomach or esophageal wall lining.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b> Stages II–III:</b> Tumors have spread deeper into the layers of the stomach
                                        or esophageal wall and to nearby lymph nodes.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage IV:</b> Tumors have spread beyond the stomach or esophagus to distant
                                        lymph nodes and parts of the body. Stage 4 stomach cancer may have a devastating
                                        effect on GIT.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Following are the esophageal and stomach cancer treatments, depending on the location
                                    and extent of cancer.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Endoscopic resection:</b> Endoscopic resection could be a treatment option for
                                    small early-stage tumors. They can be removed using a long, flexible tube
                                    (endoscopic resection) inserted through the throat to reach the tumor site. In some
                                    cases, it may be the only cure for stomach cancer and esophageal cancer.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Surgery:</b> Surgery is a common choice of treatment used to cure stomach and
                                    esophageal cancer. It aims to remove all cancer while leaving as much normal tissue
                                    as possible. Some of the healthy tissue around cancer may be removed to reduce the
                                    risk of cancer recurrence.</p><br>
                                <p>Surgical management of stomach cancer includes:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Gastrectomy:</b> It involves the removal of a part or all of the stomach, leaving
                                    as much healthy tissue as possible.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Subtotal or partial gastrectomy:</b> When a part of the stomach is removed
                                        along with nearby fatty tissue and lymph nodes, it is referred to as a subtotal
                                        or partial gastrectomy.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Total gastrectomy:</b> When the entire stomach is removed, along with the
                                        nearby fatty tissue, lymph nodes, and parts of nearby organs, it is referred to
                                        as total gastrectomy.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Surgical procedures for esophageal cancers include:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Esophagectomy:</b> It involves the removal of the tumor and part of the entire
                                    esophagus along with the affected lymph nodes, leaving as much healthy tissue as
                                    possible.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b> Radiation therapy involves the use of a controlled dose of
                                    radiation (X-rays and protons) to destroy the cancerous cells. It can be given alone
                                    or combined with chemotherapy (chemoradiation) for people with stomach or esophageal
                                    cancer. It can be used as the main treatment for cancers that have not spread to
                                    other parts of the body, or when surgery is not an option. It is used before the
                                    surgery to shrink large tumors and destroy any cancer cells that may have spread.
                                    Occasionally, the surgery may help minimize the chances of cancer recurrence, and
                                    relieve complications associated with advanced cancers.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> Chemotherapy involves the use of anti-cancer drugs to destroy or
                                    slow the growth of cancer cells. They are either given alone or combined with
                                    radiation therapy. Chemotherapy alone is used for people unable to undergo surgery.
                                    It is used before the surgery to shrink large tumors and destroy any cancer cells
                                    that may have spread. It may be used after the surgery to reduce the risk of cancer
                                    recurrence.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Targeted drug therapy:</b> Targeted therapy is designed to attack specific
                                    features of the cancer cells, thereby causing the cancer cells to die or stop
                                    spreading. They can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for advanced
                                    cancers or cancers that do not respond to other treatments.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Immunotherapy:</b> Immunotherapy is a drug treatment that boosts the immune system
                                    to fight cancer. Cancer cells remain protected from the immune system’s action as
                                    they produce proteins that interfere with and prevent the immune system from
                                    recognizing them as harmful. Immunotherapy works by interrupting that process, and
                                    is commonly used in advanced stages, or when cancer recurs.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                                <p>Stomach and esophageal cancer cannot be prevented; however certain measures can help
                                    reduce the risk. They include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Quitting smoking</li>
                                    <li> Avoiding or limiting alcohol consumption</li>
                                    <li> Eating more fruits and vegetables</li>
                                    <li> Being physically active</li>
                                    <li> Maintaining a healthy weight</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                                <p>Prognosis and survival in patients with stomach and esophageal cancer depend on the
                                    stage of the disease. A patient diagnosed with cancer at a very early stage has
                                    better chances of survival. The 5-year survival rate for cancer that is confined to
                                    the stomach is 70%. When cancer spreads to the surrounding lymph nodes or organs,
                                    the 5-year survival rate is 30%. The 5-year survival rate for esophageal cancer that
                                    is present within the esophagus is 47% and 25% for those which have spread to
                                    surrounding organs or lymph nodes. When cancer has spread to distant parts of the
                                    body, the five-year survival rate is 5%.</p>

                                <h3>A brief about blood and its components</h3>
                                <p>Blood is a connective tissue, which accounts for about 7 to 10 percent of the body
                                    weight. Apart from delivering nutrients and oxygen to cells and transporting waste
                                    from cells, it plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis and regulating the
                                    body’s systems.</p><br>
                                <h3>It has four main components, as follows:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Red blood cells (erythrocytes) account for about 40-45% volume of the blood.
                                        They carry oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues and the carbon dioxide from
                                        the tissues to the lungs with the help of a special protein called hemoglobin.
                                        They are formed in the bone marrow.</li>
                                    <li>White blood cells (leukocytes) are essential components of the immune system,
                                        which defend the body against infections and foreign bodies. They account for
                                        about one percent of the blood volume. Like other blood cells, they are
                                        primarily produced in the bone marrow.</li>
                                    <li>Platelets (thrombocytes) are small cell fragments that stop or prevent bleeding
                                        through the formation of blood clots, through a process known as coagulation.
                                        The ideal platelet range is 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter.</li>
                                    <li>Plasma refers to the liquid component of the blood that accounts for about 55%
                                        of its volume. It is a mixture of sugar, fats, protein, salts, and water. It
                                        helps to carry blood cells and nutrients throughout the body. It also carries
                                        electrolytes to the muscles and helps to maintain pH balance in the body,
                                        thereby supporting cell function.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Blood disorders</h3>
                                <p>A blood disorder is an umbrella term for all problems that involve one or more
                                    components of the blood. While many of such disorders do not cause symptoms or
                                    affect life expectancy, others could be life-threatening. Anemia, thalassemia,
                                    thrombocytopenias, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) are some of the
                                    common blood disorders discussed below.</p><br>
                                <h3>Anemia</h3>
                                <p>Anemia is a common blood disorder caused by a low number of red blood cells, and its
                                    worldwide prevalence is about 24.8%. Typically, anemia is a symptom of a condition
                                    rather than a disease itself. It could be caused due to nutritional deficiencies or
                                    arise because of other chronic or severe conditions. There are many types of anemia
                                    depending on how it occurs. Often, they are mild and treatable conditions, while
                                    others can be severe and life-threatening.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Anemia Symptoms:</b> The symptoms of anemia may vary from person to person. In its
                                    mild state, anemia may not cause any symptoms. The severe state may cause symptoms,
                                    which may include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Paleness of the skin</li>
                                    <li>Irregular heartbeat</li>
                                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                                    <li>Feeling cold</li>
                                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                                    <li>Dizziness</li>
                                    <li>Sore or a swollen tongue</li>
                                    <li>Impaired wound and tissue healing</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Causes of anemia</h3>
                                <p>The most common causes of anemia may include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Nutritional deficiencies</li>
                                    <li>Inherited, autoimmune or cancerous conditions</li>
                                    <li>Medications</li>
                                    <li>Infections</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis of anemia</h3>
                                <p>The diagnosis includes obtaining the medical and family history, followed by a
                                    physical examination to evaluate the overall health. Complete blood count (CBC) is
                                    the primary test recommended for patients with anemia, which provides information
                                    about the number of red blood cells along with their shape and size. Other tests may
                                    be recommended to identify the cause of anemia. Rarely, a bone marrow biopsy that
                                    involves obtaining a sample of bone marrow is recommended to look for defects that
                                    may lead to anemia.</p><br>
                                <h3>Treatment of anemia</h3>
                                <p>The treatment for anemia varies according to the underlying cause. Typically, it
                                    involves recommending dietary modifications and medications to improve the red blood
                                    cell count. Other treatments may involve treating the underlying diseases causing
                                    anemia. Blood transfusions or bone marrow transplantation may be required to treat
                                    certain types of anemia.</p><br>
                                <h3>Thalassemia</h3>
                                <p>Thalassemia is an inherited (passed from parents to children) blood disorder, where
                                    the body makes a lesser or abnormal form of hemoglobin. This leads to a shortage of
                                    red blood cells, depriving the cells of oxygen. It is estimated that about 1.5% of
                                    the global population are carriers of beta-thalassemia, with about 60,000
                                    symptomatic individuals being born each year.</p><br>
                                <p>Depending on the specific genetic changes causing thalassemia, it is divided into two
                                    types, namely alpha-thalassemia (mutation in HBA1 and/or HBA2 genes) and
                                    beta-thalassemia (mutation in HBB gene). Thalassemia may cause mild anemia that may
                                    not have adverse effects on health; the severe form of the same can damage organs
                                    and could turn fatal.</p><br>
                                <h3>Symptoms of Thalassemia</h3>
                                <p>People with a mild form of thalassemia have small red blood cells causing no
                                    symptoms. People with intermediate and severe forms of thalassemia can have mild to
                                    severe anemia and may experience the following symptoms.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Paleness</li>
                                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                                    <li>Yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice)</li>
                                    <li>Bone problems</li>
                                    <li>Growth failure</li>
                                    <li>Enlarged heart or liver</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Causes of Thalassemia</h3>
                                <p>Hemoglobin, a protein that helps to carry oxygen in the blood is made of two subunits
                                    known as beta globulin and alpha globulin. The defects (mutations) in the genes that
                                    provide instructions for making respective subunits lead to reduced levels of alpha
                                    or beta globulins causing thalassemia.</p><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis: Thalassemia Test</h3>
                                <p>Diagnostic tests may include blood tests such as a complete blood count to look for
                                    anemia and laboratory analysis of blood samples to detect abnormalities in the size
                                    and shape of red blood cells. Certain specific genetic mutations in the genes can be
                                    identified through mutational analysis. As thalassemia is an inherited condition,
                                    family genetic studies can help in the diagnosis of the condition.</p><br>
                                <h3>Treatment of Thalassemia</h3>
                                <p>The majority of people have mild thalassemia causing no symptoms and requiring no
                                    treatment. However, severe forms of thalassemia require regular blood transfusions,
                                    folic acid supplements, and spleen removal or bone marrow transplantations.</p><br>
                                <h3>Thrombocytopenias</h3>
                                <p>Thrombocytopenia is a condition in which the body does not produce enough platelets.
                                    It may occur as a side effect of certain medications or due to other conditions such
                                    as bone marrow or immune system disorders. It may not cause any symptoms in its mild
                                    form, but when the platelet counts are severely low, it may cause internal bleeding.
                                    It can be seen in both adults and children.</p><br>
                                <h3>Symptoms of thrombocytopenia</h3>
                                <p>The signs and symptoms of thrombocytopenia may include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Easy bruising</li>
                                    <li>Pinpoint-sized red or purple spots called petechiae, usually on the lower legs
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Prolonged bleeding from cuts</li>
                                    <li>Nosebleeds or bleeding from gums</li>
                                    <li>Blood in urine or stools</li>
                                    <li>Heavy menstrual flows</li>
                                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                                    <li>Enlarged spleen</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Causes of thrombocytopenia</h3>
                                <p>Thrombocytopenia can occur due to many reasons. The common causes of the condition
                                    may include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma</li>
                                    <li>Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy</li>
                                    <li>Antibodies that may act against healthy platelets</li>
                                    <li>Exposure to toxic chemicals or certain viruses such as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus,
                                        cytomegalovirus, or hepatitis</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>In rare cases, people with prostate or breast cancer may develop thrombocytopenia, as
                                    cancer spreads to the bone. People with spleen cancer may also develop the
                                    condition.</p><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis of thrombocytopenia</h3>
                                <p>Diagnostic tests for thrombocytopenia include obtaining medical history and family
                                    history of the patient and history of the medications taken by the patient. During a
                                    physical exam, the skin may be examined for signs of bleeding, and the abdomen is
                                    palpated to check for enlargement of the liver or spleen. Blood tests such as
                                    complete blood count and clotting tests are ordered and specialized tests such as
                                    bone marrow biopsy are recommended to look for bone marrow abnormalities.</p><br>

                                <p>Treatment primarily involves treating the underlying disease or condition that is
                                    causing the thrombocytopenia. Blood transfusions may be required when the platelet
                                    count is severely low. In certain cases, the spleen may be removed to reduce further
                                    damage to the platelets.</p><br>
                                <h3>Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)</h3>
                                <p>ITP is a bleeding disorder caused by persistently low platelets in the blood. In
                                    adults, the annual incidence of ITP is approximately 66 cases per every 1,000,000
                                    cases. In children, the incidence is about 50 cases per 1,000,000.</p><br>
                                <p>There are two forms of ITP- acute and chronic thrombocytopenic purpura. The acute
                                    form is often seen in young children may last less than six months and does not
                                    require any treatment. Chronic thrombocytopenic purpura is predominantly seen in
                                    adults and may last for at least six months. It has a higher chance to recur and
                                    requires regular follow-up care.</p><br>
                                <h3>Symptoms of ITP</h3>
                                <p>The symptoms of ITP may vary from person to person. The common symptoms may include:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Red or purple colored tiny dots beneath the skin</li>
                                    <li>Excessive bruising</li>
                                    <li>Nosebleeds</li>
                                    <li>Bleeding in the mouth or gums</li>
                                    <li>Heavy menstrual periods</li>
                                    <li>Blood in the vomit</li>
                                    <li>Blood in urine or stool</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Causes for ITP</h3>
                                <p>In most cases, ITP is linked to an autoimmune response that attacks the body’s
                                    platelets by mistake, leading to low platelet counts. Certain viral or bacterial
                                    infections such as HIV, Helicobacter pylori, or hepatitis C may also lead to ITP.
                                    Especially, in children with short-term ITP, recent infections have been found to
                                    trigger immune reactions against platelets.</p><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis of ITP</h3>
                                <p>The diagnosis starts with obtaining a complete medical history and physical
                                    examination. Blood tests such as complete blood count to measure platelet numbers
                                    along with their size and maturity are recommended. Additional blood or urine tests
                                    are recommended to determine the possible cause of the condition. Rarely, bone
                                    marrow aspiration may be used to rule out other possible causes of the condition.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>Treatment of ITP</h3>
                                <p>People with mild ITP may not require any treatment other than the regular follow-up,
                                    and the disease often resolves on its own. Children with short-term ITP also do not
                                    require any treatment unless they have bleeding symptoms.</p><br>
                                <p>Adults with chronic or long-term ITP or ITP with very low platelet counts often
                                    require treatment. The treatment may involve using medications that can improve
                                    platelet counts or treat infections that may cause low platelet counts. Patients
                                    with severe bleeding may require platelet transfusions or surgery if the condition
                                    persists even after the conventional treatments.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/braintumour.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>A brain tumor is a collection of neoplasm (abnormal and excessive growth of tissues)
                                    arising in or around the brain. These tumors can disrupt brain function and cause
                                    long-term neurological deficits and even death. Globally, brain tumors make up to
                                    1.8% of all cancer incidences. The International Association of Cancer Registries
                                    (IARC) reported that the incidence of brain tumors ranges from 5 to 10 per 100,000
                                    population in India and ranked brain tumor as the 10th most common type of tumor
                                    among Indians.</p><br>
                                <h3>About Brain tumor</h3>
                                <p>The brain is one of the most complex organs in the human body. The brain along with
                                    the spinal column makes up the central nervous system (CNS), which controls all the
                                    vital functions of the body.</p><br>
                                <p>A brain tumor is a mass of abnormal cells that grow in the brain. These abnormal
                                    cells grow rapidly and invade the healthy areas of the brain. There are different
                                    types of brain tumors; some are benign brain tumors (non-cancerous) and some can be
                                    malignant (cancerous).</p><br>
                                <p>Brain tumors can either begin in the brain (primary brain tumors) or may migrate from
                                    distant parts of the body to the brain (secondary or metastatic brain tumors).</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
                                <p>The brain tumor symptoms and signs depend on the location and size of the tumor. In
                                    most cases, brain tumors are asymptomatic during the early stage. However, when the
                                    tumor begins to grow and exert pressure on the adjacent brain tissue, the following
                                    symp may be evident:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Persistent brain tumor headaches that worsen with activity or in the morning
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Seizures</li>
                                    <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                                    <li>Difficulty concentrating or problem-solving</li>
                                    <li>Memory changes</li>
                                    <li>Mood or personality changes</li>
                                    <li>Weakness on one side of the body</li>
                                    <li>Impaired speech and language (dysarthria)</li>
                                    <li>Vision problems</li>
                                    <li>Loss of balance or coordination</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Causes and Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>Though the exact cause of brain tumor is unknown, the primary brain tumor develops
                                    when the normal cells in the brain undergo any mutation (cellular changes) and start
                                    dividing at an uncontrollable rate. The secondary tumor can be the result of cancer
                                    that might have developed in another part of the body and then spread to the brain.
                                    The growth rate, as well as the location of a tumor, determines the severity of the
                                    condition.</p><br>
                                <p>Factors that might increase the risk of brain tumor include the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Being exposed to ionizing radiations</li>
                                    <li>Having a family history of brain tumors</li>
                                    <li>Having a personal history of cancer</li>
                                    <li>Having a weak immune system</li>
                                    <li>Being exposed to certain chemicals or carcinogens</li>
                                    <li>Being exposed to electromagnetic fields</li>
                                    <li>Being overweight or obese</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Diagnostic tests for a brain tumor are recommended when a person experiences the
                                    symptoms that may signal a brain tumor. The symptoms and signs of brain tumor, along
                                    with the medical and family history of the patient are assessed to obtain a complete
                                    picture.</p><br>
                                <p>The following tests are recommended to confirm the diagnosis:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Neurological examination: This test involves examining the hearing, balance,
                                        vision, coordination, and reflexes. Abnormal findings in one or more of these
                                        examinations indicate that a specific part of the brain may be affected by a
                                        brain tumor.</li>
                                    <li>Imaging: Imaging tests like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized
                                        tomography (CT) scan, and positron emission tomography (PET) scan are used to
                                        diagnose brain tumors.</li>
                                    <li>Biopsy: For the biopsy, a small piece of the tumor is collected through
                                        minimally invasive surgery and is examined in the laboratory to confirm the
                                        diagnosis of the brain tumor and determine whether it is benign or malignant.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Skull X-Ray: An X-Ray can show the presence of skull cancers secondary to brain
                                        tumors. X-rays can also show the calcium deposits that are found inside some
                                        brain tumors.</li>
                                    <li>Electroencephalography (EEG): This test is used to monitor for possible seizure
                                        activity. In this test, several electrodes are attached to the outside of a
                                        person's head to measure the electrical activity of the brain.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Grading of the Brain Tumor</h3>
                                <p>Brain tumors are graded on a scale developed by the World Health Organization.
                                    Grading classifies tumor cells their features, how they look under the microscope
                                    and how quickly they are dividing.</p><br>
                                <h3>The grades of brain tumors include:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Grade I:</b> The tumor cells are nearly identical to healthy cells. They are
                                        slow-growing and unlikely to spread. They can often be treated with surgery.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <b>Grade II:</b> The tumor cells look slightly different from the healthy
                                        cells. These
                                        tumors are less likely to grow and spread.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Grade III:</b> The tumor cells look abnormal and actively divide. They have
                                        the
                                        potential to transform to grade 4 tumors.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Grade IV:</b> The tumor cells are actively dividing. In addition, the tumor
                                        has
                                        both blood vessel growth and areas of dead tissue. These tumors can grow and
                                        spread quickly to other body parts.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>The brain tumor treatment aims to remove the tumor as much as possible and prevent
                                    its recurrence. Based on the size and type of the tumor, its growth rate, brain
                                    location, and the general health of the patient, the treatment team may recommend
                                    any or a combination of the following treatment options:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Surgery:
                                        The surgery involves complete or partial removal of tumors surrounding the brain
                                        tissues. It is the first-line brain tumor treatment option for grade-1 tumors.
                                        Even partial removal of tumors near the sensitive areas of the brain may help
                                        reduce the signs of brain tumors and their symptoms.
                                        The possible side-effects of surgery are bleeding, infections at the incision
                                        site, blood clots, etc.</li>

                                        2. Radiation therapy:
                                        This involves delivering high-energy beams to destroy the cancer cells. It is
                                        usually done before the surgery to reduce the size of brain tumors. For brain
                                        tumors, radiation therapy is given either externally by using an external
                                        machine or internally by placing a radioactive substance near the tumor. X-rays,
                                        gamma rays, electron beams, and proton beam therapy are common energy beams used
                                        in radiation therapy. Based on the size, type, and location of the brain tumor,
                                        advanced techniques like Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT), Stereotactic
                                        Radiosurgery (SRS), and Whole-Brain Radiation therapy are used.
                                        Common side effects of radiation therapy include fatigue, headaches, memory
                                        loss, and scalp irritation.</li>

                                        3. Radiosurgery:
                                        Unlike traditional surgery, this method delivers precise, high-dose radiation
                                        directly to the tumor, which destroys the tumor cells in that area. Various
                                        technologies like the linear accelerator and gamma knife are used in
                                        radiosurgery.</li>

                                        4. Chemotherapy:
                                        Chemotherapy is the usage of drugs to destroy rapidly growing cancer cells in
                                        the body. These drugs can interfere with the process of cell division and
                                        promote cancer cell death. Chemo drugs are injected into a vein (IV) or given
                                        orally. Chemotherapy is usually given in cycles and the treatment plan includes
                                        a treatment session and a rest period allowing the body to recover. The most
                                        common drug used to treat brain tumors is temozolomide.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Common side effects of chemotherapy include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and hair
                                        loss.
                                        5. Targeted drug therapy:
                                        It uses specific drugs or other substances to identify and destroy the cancer
                                        cells without harming the healthy cells. Drugs approved for the treatment of
                                        brain tumors are bevacizumab and larotrectinib.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Preventive measures</h3>
                                <p>Although there is no way to prevent brain cancers, early diagnosis and proper
                                    treatment may reduce the risk of metastatic brain tumors. Routine screening for
                                    those with a personal and family history of cancer can help in early diagnosis.
                                    Avoiding excessive exposure to radiation and chemicals may also help in reducing the
                                    risk of developing a brain tumor.</p><br>
                                <h3>Outlook</h3>
                                <p>The outlook after a brain tumor operation depends on the size, type, and location of
                                    the tumor, and general health. Children with brain tumors need specialized
                                    approaches and care. The survival rate and recurrence rate of cancer vary with the
                                    type and grade of brain cancer and the age of the patient. Follow-up care and eating
                                    healthy, nutritious food can help in faster healing and in preventing possible
                                    complications.</p>

                                <p>Leukemia is the cancer of different types of blood cells, including the bone marrow
                                    cells and the lymphatic system. Leukemia is the 7th most common type of cancer in
                                    India. In 2018, about 32,471 deaths occurred due to leukemia in India. According to
                                    Globocan 2018, the worldwide mortality rate of leukemia was 2.5 per 100,000
                                    population.</p><br>
                                <h3>About chronic leukemia</h3>
                                <p>Chronic leukemia refers to the slowly progressing cancer that begins in the
                                    blood-forming tissues. This results in the production of a large number of abnormal
                                    white blood cells, which enter the bloodstream but are not as functional as the
                                    normal cells. Depending on the type of white blood cells affected, chronic leukemia
                                    types can be classified as <b>chronic myeloblastic leukemia (CML) and chronic
                                        lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)</b>.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chronic myeloblastic/myeloid/ myelogenous/ leukemia (CML)</b> is cancer that
                                    affects the myeloid cells in the bone marrow (spongy tissue inside the blood, which
                                    produces blood cells) and blood. Normally, myeloid cells produce platelets, red
                                    blood cells, and most types of white blood cells (except lymphocytes). Chronic
                                    myeloid leukemia cells grow, divide, and build up in the bone marrow and enter the
                                    bloodstream. Over time, these cells invade other parts of the body, such as the
                                    spleen. CML usually occurs in adults, and rarely occurs in children.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)</b> is the cancer of blood and bone marrow,
                                    which affects the lymphocytes- the white blood cells that help fight infection.
                                    Chronic lymphocytic leukemia symptoms include cells building up slowly, over time,
                                    without presenting any symptoms for years. After some time, these cells can grow and
                                    invade other parts of the body, such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and liver. CLL
                                    commonly affects older adults.</p><br>
                                <h3>Causes/Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>CML and CLL both occur due to a mutation in the DNA of the respective cells, which
                                    causes the production of abnormal, ineffective blood cells.</p><br>
                                <p>In the case of CML, this mutation can promote cancer development, by the following
                                    processes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>An abnormal chromosome develops: Certain chromosome parts may get exchanged with
                                        others, resulting in the development of an extra-short chromosome 22, called the
                                        Philadelphia chromosome. This chromosome is present in 90% of individuals with
                                        CML.</li>
                                    <li>A new gene is created in Philadelphia chromosome: A new gene is created in this
                                        chromosome which ultimately promotes cancer and allows blood cells to grow
                                        uncontrollably.</li>
                                    <li>Produces too many diseased blood cells: In CML, too many white blood cells
                                        containing the Philadelphia chromosome are produced, which does not allow the
                                        cells to grow and die normally. These cells crowd out the normal blood cells and
                                        damage the bone marrow.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Several factors may increase the risk of CML and CLL, including:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Older age (>70 years)</li>
                                    <li>Being male (in case of CLL)</li>
                                    <li>Exposure to chemicals, including certain herbicides and insecticides (in CLL)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Radiation exposure, such as radiation therapy for certain types of cancer (in
                                        CML)</li>
                                    <li>Family history (in case of CLL, not CML)</li>
                                    <li>Being white (in case of CLL)</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Chronic leukemia symptoms in the initial stages are not observed. But symptoms may
                                    develop for some patients, and include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Fever</li>
                                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                                    <li>Night sweats</li>
                                    <li>Weight loss</li>
                                    <li>Pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Chronic Myeloid Leukemia symptoms include easy bleeding, bone pain, and loss of
                                    appetite, whereas painless, enlarged lymph nodes and frequent infections may
                                    indicate CLL.</p><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>The following tests are recommended to diagnose CML and CLL.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Blood tests:</b> Complete blood cell count can help to count the number of
                                        lymphocytes and other blood cells. Blood chemistry tests can be performed to
                                        measure organ function, which may reveal certain abnormalities.</li>
                                    <li>A high number of B cells (a type of lymphocyte) can indicate CLL. A test called
                                        immunophenotyping or flow cytometry can determine if the increased lymphocytes
                                        are caused due to CLL or other blood disorders. Flow cytometry also helps to
                                        analyze the leukemia cells and predict the aggressiveness of the cells.</li>
                                    <li><b>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH):</b> This test examines the
                                        leukemia cells
                                        for genetic abnormalities. The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome indicates
                                        CML. Genetic evaluation can also be done with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
                                        test.</li>
                                    <li><b>Bone marrow tests:</b> These tests involve the collection of bone marrow
                                        samples
                                        from the hip bone, which will be analyzed in the laboratory. Bone marrow biopsy
                                        and bone marrow aspiration are commonly used to diagnose chronic leukemia.</li>
                                    <li><b>Imaging tests:</b> CT scan, MRI scan, and PET scan are performed to determine
                                        the
                                        spread of cancer, to find a suspicious area that may be cancerous, or to
                                        estimate the effectiveness of the current treatment.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Staging of CML and CLL</h3>
                                <p>The stages indicate the extent or spread of cancer. Knowing the stage of cancer helps
                                    to plan the treatment.</p><br>
                                <p>CML is classified into 3 phases - chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blastic phase,
                                    based on the number of immature white blood cells (or blast cells) and severity of
                                    the symptoms.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Chronic phase: &lt; 10% of cells in blood and bone marrow are immature white
                                        blood cells.</li>
                                    <li> Accelerated phase: 10% to 19% of cells in blood and bone marrow are blast
                                        cells.</li>
                                    <li> Blastic phase: >20% of cells in blood or bone marrow are immature white blood
                                        cells. The occurrence of fever, tiredness, and an enlarged spleen during this

                                <p>CLL has the following stages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Stage 0:</b> Too many lymphocytes in the blood, but no other symptoms of

                                    <li><b>Stage I:</b> Too many lymphocytes in the blood and lymph nodes are larger
                                        than usual.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage II:</b> Too many lymphocytes in blood; liver or spleen are larger than
                                        usual, and lymph nodes may be larger than normal.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage III:</b> Too many lymphocytes and few red blood cells in the blood.

                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Treatment for chronic leukemia depends on several factors, including the type of
                                    cancer, stage of cancer, the onset of symptoms, the overall health of the patient,
                                    and the patient’s preferences. Some cases of early-stage CLL may not receive
                                    treatment; doctors may opt to wait and monitor the condition closely until it
                                    progresses.</p><br>
                                <p>Below are the treatment options for CLL and CML:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Targeted drug therapy:</b> In this therapy, drugs that attack the cancer
                                        cells by focusing on the aspect of the cells which allows them to grow
                                        uncontrollably are used. This is the initial treatment option for patients with
                                        CML.</li>
                                    <li><b>Chemotherapy:</b> This treatment involves using drugs to kill fast-growing
                                        leukemia cells. These drugs can be given orally (pills) or intravenously
                                        (injecting into a vein). Sometimes, chemotherapy is combined with targeted drug
                                        therapy, and other treatment options to treat aggressive chronic leukemia.</li>
                                    <li><b>Immunotherapy:</b> In this therapy, the body’s immune system is boosted to
                                        fight cancer. This treatment may help the immune system identify cancer cells
                                        and/or train the immune cells to fight cancer cells.</li>
                                    <li><b>Bone marrow transplant (or stem cell transplant):</b> During the bone marrow
                                        transplant, high doses of chemo drugs are used to kill the stem cells
                                        (blood-forming cells) in the bone marrow, following which the healthy adult
                                        blood stem cells from a donor are infused into the blood. These healthy cells
                                        travel to the bone marrow and produce new, healthy blood cells to replace the
                                        leukemia cells. This treatment method is reserved for patients who haven’t
                                        benefited from other treatment options.</li>
                                    <li><b>Clinical trials:</b> Clinical trials are experiments that study the latest
                                        treatment for diseases or new ways of using the existing treatments. Clinical
                                        trials may give a chance for the patients to try new treatments but cannot
                                        guarantee the treatment outcomes. The risks and benefits of the available
                                        clinical trials can be discussed with the doctor.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Prevention:</h3>
                                <p>CLL and CML have very few known risk factors, hence there is no definite way to
                                    prevent chronic leukemia. Some types of cancer can be prevented by making lifestyle
                                    modifications and avoiding risk factors, but these may not be helpful in the case of
                                    CML and CLL. The only possibly avoidable risk factor for CML is exposure to
                                    high-dose radiation.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                                <p>The prognosis and survival of CLL and CML depend on many factors, including the type
                                    of cancer, the stage of cancer, blood cell counts, patient’s age, overall health of
                                    the patient, chromosomal changes, treatments chosen, and response to treatment. The
                                    5-year survival rate of CML and CLL is about 69.20% and 85.10%, respectively.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/kidneycancer.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Kidney cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the kidneys. It accounts for
                                    approximately 2% of all cancers worldwide. The occurrence and mortality rates of
                                    kidney cancers are rising by 2-3% per decade. Kidney cancer is the ninth most common
                                    cancer in men and the 14th most commonly occurring cancer in women. Most people with
                                    kidney cancer are elderly people and are usually diagnosed between the age of 65 and
                                    74 years.</p><br>
                                <h3>What is Kidney Cancer?</h3>
                                <p>The kidneys are a pair of fist-sized, bean-shaped organs positioned on either side of
                                    the spine, below the rib cage, and behind the abdomen. It plays a crucial role in
                                    filtering the blood and removing excess water, salt, and waste products from the
                                    body.</p><br>
                                <p>Kidney cancer begins when cells in the kidneys grow uncontrollably and form a tumor.
                                    Based on the type of cells where cancer begins, here are the types of kidney cancer:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Renal cell carcinoma (RCC):</b> It is the most common type of kidney cancer
                                        that originates in the lining of small tubules inside the kidney. RCC accounts
                                        for 90% of kidney cancer.</li>
                                    <li><b> Transitional cell carcinoma or Urothelial carcinoma:</b> It accounts for
                                        about 7% of kidney cancers. It does not originate in the kidney but begins in
                                        the lining of the renal pelvis (the point where ureters meet the kidneys).</li>
                                    <li><b> Wilms’ tumor:</b> It develops during childhood and accounts for 1% of kidney
                                        cancers.</li>
                                    <li><b> Renal sarcoma:</b> It is a rare type of kidney cancer that originates in the
                                        soft tissues of the kidney.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Kidney cancers are asymptomatic during their early stages. However, in advanced
                                    stages, the possible kidney cancer symptoms and signs include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Blood in the urine</li>
                                    <li>Back pain on one side</li>
                                    <li>A lump in the abdomen or lower back</li>
                                    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                                    <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
                                    <li>Anemia</li>
                                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                                    <li>Fever</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>If cancer spreads beyond the kidney, the person may have symptoms, such as shortness
                                    of breath, coughing up blood, bone pain, or any other specific organ-related
                                    symptoms.</p><br>
                                <h3>Causes and Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>The exact cause of kidney cancer is not known, but researchers believe that kidney
                                    cancer begins when cells in one or both kidneys undergo mutation and divide at an
                                    uncontrollable rate forming a mass called a tumor.</p><br>
                                <p>Several factors may increase the risk of kidney cancer. These include the following
                                    factors:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Smoking</li>
                                    <li>Obesity</li>
                                    <li>High blood pressure</li>
                                    <li>Male gender</li>
                                    <li>Specific inherited syndromes, such as Von-Hippel-Lindau disease</li>
                                    <li>Family history of kidney cancer</li>
                                    <li>Certain medications</li>
                                    <li>Long-term dialysis</li>
                                    <li>Long-term exposure to a chemical called trichloroethylene</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Kidney cancer is often diagnosed accidentally during imaging tests for another
                                    reason. If kidney cancer is suspected, then the signs and symptoms, medical history,
                                    and family history of the patient are reviewed.</p><br>
                                <p>In addition to a physical examination, blood tests and urinalysis are also performed.
                                    These tests may suggest the presence of kidney cancer, but they cannot be used to
                                    make a definite diagnosis of kidney disease.</p><br>
                                <p>The following tests are recommended to diagnose kidney cancer:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Biopsy:</b> It involves collecting a small sample of a tumor and viewing it under
                                    a microscope to determine if it is cancerous or non-cancerous. The procedure is
                                    guided by CT or MRI scan. Techniques used to collect the kidney tissue samples are
                                    fine-needle aspiration and needle core biopsy.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Imaging tests:</b> Tests such as computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
                                    imaging (MRI) scan, ultrasound, chest X-ray, bone scan, and angiography are
                                    recommended to visualize a kidney tumor and to check whether the tumor has spread to
                                    other body parts like bone, blood vessels, etc.</p><br>
                                <h3>Kidney cancer stages:</h3>
                                <p>The commonly used staging system for kidney cancer is the TNM system. It provides
                                    detailed information about:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Tumour (T):</b> Whether the primary tumor has grown through the kidney wall
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b> Node (N):</b> Whether cancer has spread to the surrounding lymph nodes</li>
                                    <li><b> Metastasis (M):</b> Whether cancer has spread to distant parts of the body
                                    </li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Based on the TNM system, the following are the kidney cancer stages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Stage I:</b> Cancers are confined to the kidney and are 7 cm or smaller cm
                                        in diameter.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage II:</b> Cancers are confined to the kidney, but the tumor is larger
                                        than 7 cm in diameter.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage III:</b> Cancer has spread into major veins or perinephric tissues and
                                        may or may not have spread to lymph nodes; OR
                                        Cancer cells may be outside the kidney but have not spread beyond Gerota’s
                                        fascia (tissue that encapsulates the kidneys). Cancer has spread to lymph nodes

                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>The treatment is decided depending on the type and stage of kidney cancer. Based on
                                    the benefits, possible risks, and side effects, the following treatment modalities
                                    may be recommended:</p><br>
                                <p>Surgery: Surgery is the mainstay of kidney cancer treatment. It can be performed as
                                    an open procedure, laparoscopically, or with robotic assistance. Surgical procedures
                                    used to treat kidney cancer are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>i. Nephrectomy:</b> The procedure involves whole kidney removal surgery. It
                                        is recommended for stage I kidney cancer.</li>
                                    <li> <b>ii. Partial nephrectomy:</b> In this procedure, only the part of the kidney
                                        that contains the cancer is removed, leaving the healthy part of the kidney
                                        behind.</li>
                                    <li> <b>iii. Radical nephrectomy:</b> In this procedure, the whole affected kidney
                                        along with the attached adrenal gland, nearby lymph nodes, and the surrounding
                                        fatty tissues are removed. It is often recommended for stage II and stage III
                                        kidney cancer.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b>Surgical alternatives (Local therapies):</b> Surgery is not recommended for
                                    elderly patients or people with multiple medical conditions. In such cases,
                                    nonsurgical treatments are considered safe and appropriate. The procedures include:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Cryotherapy (cryoablation):</b> This therapy uses extremely cold temperatures
                                        to destroy the tumor. During the procedure, a specialized needle is inserted
                                        into the tumor through a small incision using ultrasound or other image
                                        guidance. Cold gas is passed through the needle to freeze the cancer cells.</li>
                                    <li><b>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA):</b> This uses high-energy radio waves to heat
                                        the tumor. During the procedure, a thin, needle-like probe is placed near the
                                        tumor using ultrasound or other image guidance. An electric current is passed
                                        through the tip of the probe to destroy the cancer cells.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b>Targeted therapy:</b> This involves the use of drugs that targets specific genes,
                                    proteins, or the tissue that contributes to cancer growth and survival. In kidney
                                    cancer, targeted therapy is used:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For treating advanced cancer</li>
                                    <li>After the surgery to prevent the recurrence</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b>Immunotherapy:</b> This is also known as biologic therapy. It involves the use of
                                    specific drugs that work by stimulating the body’s immune systems to fight cancer.
                                    It is often recommended as an adjuvant treatment to prevent the recurrence of
                                    cancer.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> It involves the use of potent drugs that interfere with cell
                                    division and destroy cancer cells. These anti-cancer drugs are given through a vein
                                    (IV) or taken orally. Chemotherapy is not a standard option for kidney cancer
                                    treatment as most kidney cancer cells are resistant to chemo.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b> It involves the use of high-energy beams like X-rays to
                                    destroy tumors. It is not an effective kidney cancer treatment. Radiation therapy is
                                    often recommended when a patient cannot undergo surgery. It is used as:</p><br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A palliative therapy to ease cancer symptoms during the advanced stage of

                                    <li>An adjuvant therapy after the surgery to destroy the remaining cancer cells.
                                    </li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                                <p>There is no proven way to completely prevent kidney cancer. Managing some risk
                                    factors may help in lowering its risk. Preventive measures include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Smoking cessation</li>
                                    <li>Maintaining a healthy body weight</li>
                                    <li>Avoiding exposure to harmful carcinogens like trichloroethylene</li>
                                    <li>Controlling high blood pressure</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Kidney cancer tends to be “silent,” as it does not show any symptoms until it has
                                    spread outside the kidneys. Though the survival rate depends on the stage of cancer
                                    at the time of diagnosis, the average five-year survival rate in kidney cancer
                                    patients is 75%. Early-stage detection helps in offering the best treatment and
                                    positive long-term outcomes.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/lungcancer.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Cancer that begins in the lungs is known as lung cancer. It occurs when the cells in
                                    the lungs mutate and grow abnormally to form a mass of cells; these cells may or may
                                    not spread to the other parts of the body.</p><br>
                                <p>Lung cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death
                                    worldwide. In 2018, about 2.1 million lung cancer cases were estimated globally with
                                    1.8 million deaths.</p><br>
                                <h3>Types of lung cancer</h3>
                                <p>Based on how the cells appear under the microscope, lung cancer is divided into the
                                    following types:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC):</b> SCLC is aggressive cancer that accounts for
                                    10-15% of all lung cancers. It is usually observed in heavy smokers and about 70% of
                                    cancers are at the advanced stages when diagnosed.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):</b> NSCLC is more common than SCLC, which
                                    accounts for about 80-85% of all lung cancers. NSCLC is sub-divided into squamous
                                    cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma.</p><br>
                                <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                                <p>The symptoms of lung cancer may vary among individuals. Typically, they are not
                                    apparent during the earlier stages of cancer and may appear only during the advanced
                                    stage.</p><br>
                                <p>The signs and symptoms of lung cancer may include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Persistent cough that may get worsen</li>
                                    <li>Coughing up blood</li>

                                <p>The exact cause of lung cancer is unknown. However, these risk factors increase the
                                    chance of developing lung cancer.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Smoking</li>
                                    <li>Second-hand smoke exposure</li>
                                    <li>Radon gas exposure</li>
                                    <li>Family history of lung carcinoma</li>
                                    <li>History of radiation therapy for chest</li>
                                    <li>Exposure to Asbestos, arsenic, chromium, and some forms of silica</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Chronic smokers, people aged above 55 years, and people who have a high risk of lung
                                    carcinoma must undergo yearly screening. Some lung cancers can be identified by
                                    screening, but the majority of them are only found when they start causing problems.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>Following are the diagnostic tests that may be recommended to check for the presence
                                    of cancer or to rule out other conditions.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Medical history and physical examination:</b> Details related to possible risk
                                    factors and symptoms are obtained. Physical examination is performed and involves
                                    the identification of possible signs of the presence of other health problems.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>When lung carcinoma is suspected, more detailed tests are recommended and may
                                    include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Chest X-ray:</b> It is a primary imaging test recommended to reveal any
                                        abnormal areas in the lungs.</li>
                                    <li><b>Sputum cytology:</b> A sputum sample is collected and checked for the
                                        presence of lung cancer cells under the microscope. Samples are often collected
                                        early in the morning for at least three consecutive days to obtain reliable
                                        results.</li>
                                    <li><b>Biopsy:</b> A biopsy involves obtaining a sample of abnormal tissue from the
                                        affected area and observing it under the microscope to find any abnormalities.
                                        It can be performed in many ways depending on the location of the tumor.</li>
                                    <li><b>Bronchoscopy:</b> During bronchoscopy, a lighted tube is passed through the
                                        throat into the lungs to look for abnormalities, such as tumors or blockages in
                                        the larger airways of the lungs, which can be biopsied during the procedure.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Mediastinoscopy:</b> During a mediastinoscopy, a lighted tube is inserted
                                        through an incision made at the base of the neck into the space in the chest
                                        between the lungs, called the mediastinum. Tissue samples can be taken from the
                                        lymph nodes along the windpipe or the bronchi.</li>
                                    <li><b>Fine needle aspiration (FNA):</b> A procedure known as transtracheal FNA or
                                        transbronchial fine FNA can be performed during which a fine needle is passed
                                        through the wall of the trachea or bronchi to withdraw abnormal cells.</li>
                                    <li><b>Transthoracic needle biopsy:</b> During this procedure, an X-ray or CT scan
                                        is used to guide a needle through the chest wall into the lung tissue to obtain
                                        the cells for examination.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>The cells obtained are sent for laboratory analysis that can provide information
                                    about the type of lung cancer. The extensive analysis also helps to determine
                                    specific characteristics of the cancer cells, thereby helping in the treatment plan.

                                <p>Imaging tests are done to identify the presence of cancer and to check for the extent
                                    of cancer spread to other parts of the body (cancer staging).</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Computer Tomography (CT):</b> A CT scan can help detect tumors that may
                                        remain unnoticed in routine chest X-rays. It provides information related to the
                                        size, shape, and position of the lung tumors. It may also help to look if cancer
                                        has spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver or adrenal glands.</li>
                                    <li><b>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):</b> An MRI can reveal the size, location,
                                        and extent of a lung tumor.</li>
                                    <li><b>Positron emission tomography (PET) scan:</b> A PET scan uses a radioactive
                                        substance (tracer) to look for abnormalities in the lung tissues. Often it is
                                        combined with a CT scan to help differentiate between cancerous and noncancerous
                                        tumors.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Stages of lung cancer</h3>
                                <p>Staging of lung cancer plays a key role in treatment planning and also helps to know
                                    the prognosis of lung cancer.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Stage 0: </b>The tumor is confined to the top layer of cells lining the lungs
                                        and does not spread into deeper tissues of the lungs.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage I:</b> Cancer has invaded lung tissues but has not spread to nearby
                                        lymph nodes.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage II:</b> Cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage III:</b> Cancer has spread into the lymph nodes in the space between
                                        the lungs.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IV:</b> Cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes or organs, such as the
                                        brain, bones, or liver.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Lung cancer treatment depends on many factors such as the type and extent of lung
                                    cancer, the patient’s general health, and his treatment preferences.</p><br>
                                <h3>Surgery</h3>
                                <p>Surgery involves the removal of the tumor along with the margin of the surrounding
                                    healthy tissue. The surgery requires general anesthesia and is performed by making a
                                    large incision in the chest wall between the ribs. This procedure is known as
                                    thoracotomy.</p><br>
                                <p>Types of lung cancer surgery:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Pneumonectomy:</b> Involves removal of the whole lung</li>
                                    <li><b>Lobectomy:</b> Involves removal of the entire lobe containing the tumor</li>
                                    <li><b>Segmentectomy (wedge resection):</b> Involves removal of a part of the lobe
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Segmental resection:</b> Involves removal of a slightly larger portion of the
                                        lung, but not an entire lobe</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <p>During surgery, the lymph nodes may also be removed from the chest to check if cancer
                                    has spread to areas other than the lungs.</p><br>
                                <h3>Radiation therapy</h3>
                                <p>Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to destroy cancer cells. It can be used
                                    before the surgery to shrink the tumor or after the surgery to destroy the cancer
                                    cells, which may have been left behind. Radiation therapy is often combined with
                                    chemotherapy in advanced-stage lung cancer or if surgery is not an option.</p><br>
                                <p>Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is a type of radiation therapy that involves
                                    administering radiotherapy from many different angles around the body. People with
                                    small lung cancers who are not candidates for surgery can be treated with SRT. It
                                    may also be used to treat lung carcinoma that has spread to other parts of the body,
                                    including the brain.</p><br>
                                <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
                                <p>Chemotherapy involves using anti-cancer drugs that are given either intravenously or
                                    orally to kill cancer cells. It is either used alone or in combination with
                                    radiation therapy. It can be used before the surgery to shrink the tumor or after
                                    the surgery to destroy the cancer cells that could be left behind. It may also help
                                    to relieve symptoms such as pain during advanced lung carcinoma.</p><br>
                                <h3>Targeted drug therapy</h3>
                                <p>Targeted drug treatments focus on specific changes within the cancer cells that help
                                    them grow, divide and spread. The featured advantage of targeted therapy is that it
                                    helps to specifically target the cancerous cells, thereby minimizing the damage to
                                    normal cells.</p><br>
                                <h3>Immunotherapy</h3>
                                Immunotherapy triggers the immune system to control or eliminate cancer. It is often
                                recommended for patients with locally advanced cancers and cancers that have spread to
                                other parts of the body.
                                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                                <p>Lung carcinoma cannot be prevented; however, evidence suggests that the risk of lung
                                    cancer may be decreased by:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Smoking cessation</li>
                                    <li>Avoiding secondhand smoke</li>
                                    <li>Avoiding exposure to carcinogens</li>
                                    <li>Being physically active</li>
                                    <li>Consuming fruits and vegetables</li>
                                    <li>Consuming foods rich in retinol, beta-carotene or carotenoids, vitamin C
                                        (current smokers)</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                                <p>The survival rates vary depending on the extent of cancer spread at the time of
                                    diagnosis. An early diagnosis significantly improves the outcomes with timely
                                    therapeutic intervention. However, as lung cancer does not usually cause noticeable
                                    symptoms until advanced stages, the outlook for the condition is poor compared to
                                    other cancer types. About one in three people with this condition live for at least
                                    one year after they are diagnosed and about one in 20 people live for at least ten
                                    years.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/neuroendocrine.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Neuroendocrine cancer is a relatively rare and heterogeneous type of malignancy. It
                                    comprises approximately 2% of all malignancies, with a prevalence of 5.25 cases per
                                    100,000 population. Though neuroendocrine cancers are rare in occurrence, they can
                                    develop anywhere in the body. Due to the marked heterogeneity in risk factors,
                                    biological behaviors, and response to treatment, the management of these cancers is
                                    complex.</p><br>
                                <h3>What is neuroendocrine cancer?</h3>
                                <p>Neuroendocrine cancers are carcinomas that arise from specialized body cells called
                                    neuroendocrine cells. These are the cells that interact with the nervous system or
                                    glands that produce hormones. They release hormones into the blood in response to
                                    signals from the nervous system.</p><br>
                                <p>Neuroendocrine carcinomas develop when these hormone-producing cells undergo any
                                    sudden mutation (changes) and grow out of control, forming a tumor. These
                                    neuroendocrine tumors (NET) can be either benign (non-cancerous) or
                                    malignant (cancerous). Some tumor cells can produce excess hormones while others
                                    don't release hormones or cause any symptoms.</p><br>
                                <h3>Types:</h3>
                                <p>Though there are many types of neuroendocrine tumors, the most common types are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Carcinoid tumors:</b> NETs that arise in the digestive tract, lungs,
                                        appendix, or
                                        thymus.</li>
                                    <li>They can also grow in the lymph nodes, brain, bone, ovaries, and testes or skin.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b> Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors:</b> Also called islet cell tumors, these
                                        arise in
                                        the cells of the pancreas.</li>

                                    <li> <b>Pheochromocytoma:</b> These are rare types of NET that usually develops in
                                        the adrenal glands.</li>

                                <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Because neuroendocrine cancer originates at different locations, the signs and
                                    symptoms vary depending on where the tumor is located, and the kind of hormones
                                    released.</p><br>
                                <p>The general symptoms related to the size and/or location of the tumor are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Persistent pain in a specific area</li>

                                    <li> Changes in the bowel or bladder habits</li>
                                    <li> Jaundice, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes</li>
                                    <li> Unusual bleeding or discharge</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Symptoms related to the release of excess hormones are:</p>

                                <h3>Neuroendocrine Tumor Causes/ Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>The exact cause of neuroendocrine tumors is not clear. However, some factors are
                                    known to increase the risk of developing such cancers. </p><br>
                                <p>Risk factors associated with neuroendocrine cancers are:</p><br>
                                <p>Inherited syndromes, such as:</p>
                                <ul>

                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Making a diagnosis of a rare malignancy like neuroendocrine cancer can often be
                                    challenging. Most NETs are found unexpectedly during any medical procedure done for
                                    reasons unrelated to the tumor. If a doctor suspects a NET, the medical and family
                                    history is initially reviewed followed by a complete physical examination.</p><br>
                                <p>The following tests are recommended for detailed diagnosis:</p><br>
                                <h3>Blood/urine tests:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Complete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistry studies to check certain
                                        substances in the blood</li>
                                    <li>24-hour urine collection to detect the level of serotonin in the body</li>
                                    <li>Tumor marker test to measure the level of chromogranin A, a protein released
                                        from the neuroendocrine cells</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b> Endoscopy:</b> In this procedure, a small endoscope (a thin flexible tube with a
                                    video camera at the end) is inserted into the area suspected to have the tumor. It
                                    allows visualization of the inside of the body and checks for abnormalities. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p> <b>Imaging tests:</b> Tests such as ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scan,
                                    and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done to examine the suspicious area to
                                    determine the extent of the cancer spread. Specialized scans like the octreotide
                                    scan and PET scan help in determining the neuroendocrine tumors. </p><br>
                                <p> <b>Biopsy:</b> It involves the removal of some tumor tissues from the suspicious
                                    area using a needle and its analysis under a microscope. The procedure is guided
                                    by CT or MRI scanning. </p><br>
                                <p> <b>Molecular testing of the tumor:</b> This is a laboratory test on the tumor cells
                                    to identify specific genes, proteins, and other features of the tumor.</p><br>
                                <h3>Staging</h3>
                                <p>Staging of cancer provides a uniform way to describe the location of the tumor, its
                                    size, and if or where it has spread. Neuroendocrine tumor staging depends on the
                                    location of the tumor. For E.g., staging of NETs of the GI tract and pancreas will
                                    be different from the lung NET.</p><br>
                                <p>Grading of the tumor according to the World Health Organization (WHO) is as follows:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Grade 1:</b> Low-grade tumor that divides at a low rate</li>
                                    <li> <b>Grade 2:</b> an intermediate-grade tumor that divides at an intermediate
                                        rate</li>
                                    <li> <b>Grade 3:</b> High-grade tumor that divides at a fast rate and grows quickly
                                    </li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Treatment options and recommendations for NETs usually depend on several factors,
                                    including:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> The type of NET</li>
                                    <li> Stage and grade</li>
                                    <li> Possible side effects</li>
                                    <li> Overall health of the patient</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>In general, neuroendocrine tumor treatment modalities may include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Surgery:</b> It is often the first-line treatment for patients with
                                        localized NETs and some metastatic cases. Most common neuroendocrine tumor
                                        surgeries include:</li>
                                    <li><b>Excision:</b> removal of a tumor along with a small amount of surrounding
                                        healthy tissues</li>
                                    <li> <b>Resection:</b> removal of the organ in which the tumor originated</li>
                                    <li> <b>Fulguration:</b> surgical destruction of tumors using electrical currents
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <b>Cryosurgery:</b> the destruction of cancerous tissue through exposure to
                                        extreme cold temperature</li>
                                    <li> <b>Radiofrequency ablation:</b> surgical destruction of tumors using
                                        high-energy radio waves</li>
                                    <li> <b>Hepatic artery embolization:</b> blocking the blood supply to cancerous

                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Possible side effects of surgery include bleeding, infection, anesthesia risks, and
                                    the risk of blood clots post-surgery.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Chemotherapy:</b> For treating neuroendocrine tumors, chemo drugs are used
                                        either:</li>
                                    <li> Before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) to help shrink a tumor</li>
                                    <li> After surgery to help destroy any residual cancer cells and to prevent the
                                        reoccurrence of cancer</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Chemotherapy is usually given in several cycles, which involves a period of treatment
                                    followed by a rest period, allowing the body to recover from its side effects. There
                                    is no standard chemotherapy regimen for neuroendocrine tumor therapy. The drugs or
                                    drugs combinations are recommended based on the site of tumor occurrence and grade.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>Common side effects of chemotherapy are fatigue, nausea and vomiting, loss of
                                    appetite, hair loss, and diarrhea.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Targeted drug therapy:</b> Targeted drugs work by interfering with
                                        substances like genes or proteins that contribute to the growth and survival of
                                        cancer. For advanced neuroendocrine tumors, targeted drug therapy is combined
                                        with chemotherapy for better results. The side effects differ for each patient
                                        depending on the type of tumor and the drugs used.</li>
                                    <li> Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy is recommended for the NETs in the
                                        advanced stage and if the location of the tumor would likely complicate the
                                        surgical procedures. It involves the use of high-energy radiation to kill cancer
                                        cells. The treatment approach can vary for each patient depending on the grade
                                        and location of the tumor. Side effects from the radiation therapy may include
                                        mild skin reactions, fatigue, hair loss, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT):</b> PRRT is a drug therapy in
                                        which the drugs that target the cancer cells are combined with radioactive
                                        substances. These radioactive drugs specifically act on the cancer cells and
                                        destroy them by emitting radiation. This is usually recommended for advanced GI
                                        tract NETs and pancreatic NETs. Possible side effects include low white blood
                                        cell count, high enzyme levels in some organs, high blood sugar level, low level
                                        of potassium, and nausea and vomiting.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Medications to control excess hormones:</b> Somatostatin analogs are drugs
                                        that are similar to somatostatin - a hormone that controls the release of
                                        several other hormones, such as insulin and glucagon. These drugs help manage
                                        the symptoms due to the hormone-like substances released by a NET.</li>

                                <h3>Outlook</h3>
                                <p>It is difficult to predict the prognosis of neuroendocrine tumors because each
                                    patient responds differently to the treatment. However, the prognosis and survival
                                    rate of NETs depend on the primary tumor sites. Other factors that affect the
                                    prognosis are the stage and characteristics of cancer, the treatments are chosen,
                                    and the overall health of the patient. The difficulty in diagnosing these rare
                                    malignancies also contributes to mortality.</p><br>

                                <p>Prostate cancer develops in the prostate gland and is the most diagnosed male
                                    malignancy. It accounted for 1.3 million new cases worldwide in the year 2018; it is
                                    the third-leading cause of cancer death in men globally. In developing countries
                                    like India, there is an increasing trend in the incidence of prostate cancer.</p>

                                <p>The prostate is a small walnut-shaped gland in men and is responsible for the
                                    production of semen. It is located underneath the urinary bladder in front of the
                                    rectum.</p><br>
                                <p>Prostate cancer develops when cells in the prostate gland begin to grow in an
                                    uncontrolled way forming a tumor. About 90% of prostate cancers
                                    are adenocarcinomas in which the cancers develop from the gland cells that produce
                                    seminal fluid.</p><br>
                                <h3>Types:</h3>
                                <p>Prostate cancer is of two types:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Aggressive prostate cancer or fast-growing prostate cancer: This type of cancer
                                        grows rapidly and has a higher chance to spread to other parts of the body, such
                                        as bones.</li>
                                    <li> Non-aggressive or slow-growing prostate cancer: This type of cancer grows
                                        slowly and rarely spreads to distant parts of the body.</li>

                                <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Early prostate cancer usually causes no specific symptoms. As the cancer advances,
                                    one may experience the following symptoms:</p>

                                <h3>Causes/Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>Even though the exact cause of the development of prostate cancer is unknown,
                                    researchers believe that prostate cancer may develop due to sudden changes in the
                                    cells of the prostate gland. However, some factors may increase the risk of prostate
                                    cancer. These include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Older age, especially after 50 years</li>
                                    <li> Family history of prostate cancer</li>
                                    <li> Inherited genetic mutations like Lynch syndrome</li>
                                    <li> Exposure to certain chemicals</li>
                                    <li> Obesity</li>
                                    <li> Unhealthy eating habits</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Prostate cancer is asymptomatic during the early stages. So, any individual between
                                    55 to 69 years of age with a family history of prostate cancer is recommended to
                                    undergo regular screening. Prostate cancer can be screened with the following tests:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> PSA Blood Test:</b> The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test measures
                                        the level of PSA protein in the blood; an elevated level may indicate prostate
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <b>DRE:</b> The digital rectal examination (DRE) involves inserting a gloved,
                                        lubricated finger into the rectum to check for any abnormalities in that area.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <b>Tumor marker test:</b> Tumor markers are proteins that are secreted by the
                                        cancer cells. The presence of such markers in blood indicates cancer. Biomarker
                                        tests for prostate cancer include the 4Kscore and Prostate Health Index (PHI).
                                    </li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>If prostate cancer is suspected from initial examinations, the following tests
                                    may be recommended for further evaluation:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS):</b> TRUS can help calculate the PSA density
                                        or can be combined with MRI for a detailed examination of the suspicious area.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <b>Biopsy:</b> A small sample of the suspected tissue is removed and examined
                                        under a microscope to determine if it is cancerous or non-cancerous. The
                                        procedure is guided by a CT or an MRI scan. A core needle biopsy is usually the
                                        type of biopsy done to diagnose prostate cancer.</li>
                                    <li> <b>PCA3 test:</b> It is an assay test to identify the PCA3 gene in the urine
                                        sample. Elevated levels of the PCA3 gene indicate prostate cancer.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <p>When these tests confirm the presence of cancer, it will be graded using the Gleason
                                    score. Higher grades are for aggressive cancers that are more likely to grow and
                                    spread quickly. Lower grades are for normal prostate tissues. If cancer has a high
                                    Gleason score, imaging test like whole-body bone scan, computerized tomography (CT)
                                    scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done to determine the extent of its
                                    spread.</p><br>
                                <h3>Stages of prostate cancer</h3>
                                <p>The prostate cancer staging is done using the Tumour, Node, and Metastasis (TNM)
                                    staging system. It provides detailed information about:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> The size and extent of the tumor</li>
                                    <li> Whether cancer has spread to the surrounding lymph nodes</li>
                                    <li> Whether cancer has spread to distant parts of the body</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Based on this system, the prostate cancer has the following stages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Stage I:</b> Cancer cells are slow-growing. The tumor cannot be felt and
                                        involves less than one-half side of the prostate.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage II:</b> Cancer cells are confined to the pancreas. The tumor is large
                                        enough to be felt on a rectal examination.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage III:</b> Cancer cells have grown outside the prostate gland and may
                                        have invaded the nearby structures, such as the bladder or rectum, but not to
                                        the distant parts of the body.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage IV:</b> Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as bones
                                        and lungs.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Prostate Cancer Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Treatment options for prostate cancer are based on the aggressiveness of the tumor,
                                    the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis, and overall health. Treatment
                                    modalities for prostate cancer are:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Observation/ Active surveillance:</b> It does not help treat cancer, instead it
                                    helps to monitor the slow-growing tumors. Regular screening, routine follow-up blood
                                    tests, and rectal examinations are performed to monitor the progression of cancer.
                                    If the test results indicate cancer progression, then prostate treatments are
                                    decided to remove or destroy cancer.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Surgery:</b> It is recommended when the cancer is situated locally in the prostate
                                    gland. Prostate surgery and surrounding lymph nodes surgeries are involved
                                    procedures. Types of prostate surgeries include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Prostatectomy: It involves the removal of the entire prostate gland and the
                                        seminal vesicles to remove the cancer cells. It is also called radical
                                        prostatectomy.</li>
                                    <li> Robotic-assistedted prostatectomy: This is a highly specialized procedure, in
                                        which the surgery is performed using the robotic arms that hold the surgical
                                        instruments and a camera, controlled by a surgeon in the console. It is
                                        recommended for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer located in
                                        a tightly confined area or close to nerves that can affect urinary and sexual
                                        functions. This is less invasive than the manual procedure and has a better
                                        prostate cancer prognosis.</li>
                                    <li> Bilateral orchiectomy: It is usually recommended for locally advanced and
                                        metastatic pancreatic cancers. This procedure involves the removal of both
                                        testicles. Prostate cancer surgery helps in stopping the production of
                                        testosterone and its action on the prostate cells.</li>
                                    <li> Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): In some cases, the tumor may
                                        block the bladder and cause difficulty in passing urine. During a TURP, a
                                        resectoscope (a thin metal tube containing a light and tiny camera at one end)
                                        is inserted through the urethra into the prostate. A surgical tool is then
                                        passed through the tube to remove the blockage.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Radiation therapy for prostate cancer:  It uses high-energy radiation like X-rays to
                                    destroy the cancer cells. Depending upon the stage, the radiation therapy is used:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> As the first-line treatment for cancer </li>
                                    <li> As a part of the main treatment</li>
                                    <li> As an adjuvant treatment to prevent the recurrence of cancer</li>
                                    <li> To manage symptoms caused by advanced cancer</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Depending on the stage of cancer, radiation therapy is given either externally
                                    through an external source or internally by placing a radiation source near the
                                    tumor to deliver high-dose rays.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Hormone therapy:</b> It is used to block certain hormones that aid in the growth
                                    of cancer cells. Lowering androgen often makes prostate cancers shrink or make them
                                    grow slowly for a time. It is often used with other treatment options to prevent a
                                    recurrence.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> This involves the use of potent drugs to stop the cancer cells
                                    from growing further or to destroy them. It is usually used for cancers that have
                                    spread beyond the prostate gland and are no longer responding to hormonal therapy.
                                </p><br>
                                <p><b>Cryotherapy:</b> This involves the usage of extremely cold temperatures to freeze
                                    and kill prostate cancer cells. It is recommended for patients with low-risk
                                    early-stage prostate cancer who cannot have surgery or radiation therapy.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Immunotherapy:</b> It involves the use of specific drugs to stimulate a patient’s
                                    immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells more effectively. </p><br>
                                <h3>How to prevent prostate cancer?</h3>
                                <p>There is no absolute way to prevent prostate cancers. Managing certain risk factors
                                    may reduce the risk of developing cancer. These include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Practice healthy eating habits. Include foods like soy, tomatoes, fish, omega-3
                                        fatty acids-rich oils, cruciferous vegetables, and fruits in your diet.</li>
                                    <li> Manage your body weight.</li>
                                    <li> Exercise regularly.</li>
                                    <li> Limit alcohol and quit smoking.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Unlike other cancers, prostate cancers generally tend to grow slowly with relatively
                                    low risk and limited aggressiveness. The survival rates depend on the stage of
                                    cancer at the time of diagnosis. The average five-year survival rate for patients
                                    with stage I and II prostate cancer is 100%. The rate decreases to 31% for stage IV
                                    cancer patients. Advanced treatment options and healthy living habits will help in
                                    better outcomes.</p>

                                <h3>About testicular cancer</h3>
                                <p>Testicular cancer begins when healthy cells in a testicle undergo mutation (change)
                                    and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumor. Testicles are two small
                                    egg-shaped glands located below the penis and are held inside a sac of loose skin
                                    called the scrotum. They produce the male hormone testosterone, and sperms, the male
                                    cells needed for reproduction.</p><br>
                                <p>The testicles are made up of many types of cells which on mutation can develop into
                                    one or more types of cancer. Around 95% of testicular cancers are germ cell (produce
                                    sperms) testicular cancers. Two main subtypes of testicular germ cell tumors or
                                    cancers are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Seminoma:</b> They are non-aggressive cancers and tend to grow and spread
                                        more slowly than non-seminomas.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Non-seminoma:</b> They are aggressive cancers and tend to grow rapidly and
                                        spread outside the testicles.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer often appear at an early stage. An enlarged
                                    testicle or a small lump is the first sign of testicular cancer. Other important
                                    symptoms are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Dull ache in the lower abdomen or the groin</li>
                                    <li> Sudden swelling in the scrotum</li>
                                    <li> Pain or discomfort in a testicle or the scrotum</li>
                                    <li> Back pain</li>
                                    <li> Enlargement or tenderness of the breasts</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>As the cancer advances to different body parts, one may experience:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Low back pain</li>
                                    <li> Shortness of breath, chest pain, or a cough </li>
                                    <li> Belly pain</li>
                                    <li> Headaches or confusion</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Risks For Developing Testicular Cancer: Testicular cancer is more likely to occur in
                                    people with the following risk factors:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> An undescended testicle (cryptorchidism )</li>
                                    <li> Abnormal development of the testicles</li>
                                    <li> A personal history of testicular cancer</li>
                                    <li> Having certain genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome or Klinefelter
                                        syndrome</li>
                                    <li> Having a family history of testicular cancer</li>
                                    <li> Being white</li>
                                    <li> Been diagnosed as HIV positive</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>When a person experiences any signs and symptoms, the testicle doctor specialist may
                                    initially, review the medical history and conduct a detailed physical examination.
                                     If any suspicious pea-sized lump on testicle or mass is detected during the
                                    physical examination, the following tests are recommended for a detailed diagnosis.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Blood tests/tumor markers:</b> Blood tests help to detect proteins known as
                                        tumor markers; elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic
                                        gonadotrophin, and lactate dehydrogenase in the blood can be considered a strong
                                        indication of testicular cancer.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Ultrasound:</b> The sound waves are used to create detailed images of the
                                        internal organs. It helps to identify whether the testicular tumor is more
                                        likely to be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).</li>
                                    <li> <b>Imaging test:</b> Tests such as computerized tomography (CT) scan, magnetic
                                        resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan, and chest X-ray is performed to detect the
                                        extent of cancer spread.</li>
                                </ul><br>

                                <p>Testicular cancer staging is based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer
                                    (AJCC) TNM system. It provides detailed information about:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Tumour (T):</b> Whether the primary tumor has grown through the testicles
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <b>Node (N):</b> Whether cancer has spread to the surrounding testicular lymph
                                        nodes</li>
                                    <li> <b>Metastasis (M):</b> Whether cancer has spread to distant parts of the body
                                    </li>
                                    <li> <b>Serum (S):</b> Whether the blood levels of tumor markers are higher than
                                        normal</li>

                                <h3>Testicular Cancer Stages:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Stage 0:</b> Cancer cells are located within the seminiferous tubules inside
                                        the testicles.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage I testicular cancer:</b>  Cancer cells have grown beyond the
                                        seminiferous tubules, but are still within the testicle, and haven’t grown into
                                        nearby blood vessels or lymph nodes.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage II:</b> Cancer cells may or may not have grown outside the
                                        testicles and have spread to one or more nearby lymph nodes. But it hasn’t
                                        spread to distant parts of the body.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage III:</b> Cancer cells may or may not have grown outside the
                                        testicle or nearby lymph nodes. It has spread to distant parts of the body like
                                        lungs, and bones. These are late-stage testicular cancer symptoms.</li>

                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>If you are diagnosed with testicular cancer, the healthcare team would decide the
                                    treatment based on the overall health, the type of testicular cancer, and the stage
                                    at which the cancer is diagnosed. The cancer care team would also discuss the
                                    possible side effects, risks, and benefits of each treatment.</p><br>
                                <p>The treatment options for testicular cancer are:</p><br>
                                <p> <b>Surgery:</b> Surgery is the main treatment for nearly all types and stages of
                                    testicular cancer. It involves the removal of the testicle through an incision made
                                    in the groin.</p><br>
                                <p>Inguinal orchiectomy involves the removal of the entire testicle, the procedure is
                                    called orchiectomy. The testicle is then examined under a microscope to
                                    determine the type of cancer and its stage. If the cancer is aggressive and more
                                    likely to metastasize, a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) may be
                                    performed.</p><br>
                                <p>Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection (RPLND) is the surgical procedure to remove the
                                    lymph nodes of the retroperitoneum (space behind the peritoneal membrane that lines
                                    the abdominal cavity). This is a complex and long operation; however, a laparoscopic
                                    approach may be considered to reduce post-surgery complications.</p><br>
                                <p>The common side effects of surgery are reactions to anesthesia, excess bleeding,
                                    blood clots, infections, and erectile dysfunction.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Testicular Cancer Chemotherapy:</b> Chemotherapy involves the use of potent
                                    anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells. These drugs enter the bloodstream and
                                    travel throughout the body to destroy the cancer cells. For testicular cancers,
                                    chemotherapy is used in the following roles:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> As a standard treatment for advanced cancers (Stage I and II)</li>
                                    <li> As adjuvant therapy (after surgery) to prevent the recurrence of cancer</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Chemotherapy is administered in several cycles followed by a rest period to allow the
                                    body time to recover. The patients may receive a single or combination of drugs for
                                    better results. Chemotherapy cycles may begin soon after the orchiectomy is
                                    performed.</p><br>
                                <p>Possible side effects of chemotherapy include nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite,
                                    hair loss, mouth sores, diarrhea or constipation, increased chance of infections,
                                    and fatigue.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b> Radiation therapy involves the use of high-energy radiation
                                    (such as gamma rays or x-rays) to slow down the growth of cancer cells or destroy
                                    it.  It usually begins after the orchiectomy procedure.</p><br>
                                <p>Radiation therapy is used in the following cases:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> In stage I cancer as an adjuvant therapy to prevent the recurrence of cancer
                                    </li>
                                    <li> In stages II and III as the main treatment to manage the symptoms</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>For testicular cancers, high-energy beams are delivered at the site of the tumor
                                    through an external source (external beam radiation therapy). It is an outpatient
                                    procedure that is usually given over several weeks.</p><br>
                                <p>Common side effects of radiation therapy may include fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.
                                    Some men may also experience redness, blistering, and peeling at the delivery site.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>Preventive measures</h3>
                                <p>There are no preventive measures for testicular cancer as there are no known
                                    lifestyle risk factors.  Routine screening for men with cryptorchidism, family
                                    history, and other non-modifiable risk factors can help in early diagnosis. </p><br>
                                <h3>Outlook</h3>
                                <p>Testicular cancers usually have an excellent prognosis. The prognosis depends on the
                                    stage at the time of diagnosis, the type of cancer, and the overall health of the
                                    patient. Men with stage I and II cancers are likely to be cured with surgery and
                                    radiation therapy. Even men with the most advanced case have a fair average
                                    five-year survival rate.</p>

                                <p>Oral cancer accounts for most head and neck cancers. About 90% of oral cancers are
                                    squamous cell carcinomas, where cancer occurs in the thin, flat cells lining the
                                    oral cavity.</p><br>
                                <p>The tongue and buccal mucosa are parts of the oral cavity. The buccal mucosa is the
                                    lining of the back of the lips, cheeks, and the part where they touch the teeth. The
                                    buccal area plays an important role in bolus formation and preventing food from
                                    spilling. Cancer can occur when the cells form lesions in the buccal cavity or
                                    tongue.</p><br>
                                <h3>About tongue and buccal mucosa cancer</h3>
                                <p>Tongue and buccal mucosa cancer occur when the cells that makeup these parts grow out
                                    of control and form tumors or lesions. Cancer usually occurs in the squamous cells
                                    lining the buccal mucosa and tongue.</p><br>
                                <p>Tongue cancer can originate in the forward portion of the tongue (squamous cell
                                    cancer of the oral tongue) or at the rear part of the tongue (squamous cell cancer
                                    at the base of the tongue or oropharyngeal cancer). The characteristics of these two
                                    types of cancers are distinct.</p><br>
                                <p>In comparison to other types of cancers, oral cancers occur rarely; they contribute
                                    to only three percent of all cancers.</p><br>
                                <h3>Causes/ Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>The exact cause of tongue and buccal mucosa cancer is not known. However, several
                                    factors can increase the risk of this cancer. Some of these factors include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Inadequate oral hygiene</li>
                                    <li> Thickened white patches on the mucous membrane</li>
                                    <li> commonon among men</li>
                                    <li> More likely to occur at 50 - 80 years of age</li>
                                    <li> Alcoholism</li>
                                    <li> Tobacco smoking</li>
                                    <li> Cirrhosis of the liver</li>
                                    <li> Syphilis</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Tongue Cancer Symptoms and Signs</h3>
                                <p>Usually, a pinkish-red sore at the side of the tongue that does not heal over time is
                                    the first sign of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. In most cases, this sore
                                    may bleed if touched or bitten.</p><br>
                                <p>Other symptoms of tongue cancer include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> White, red, or dark patches on the tongue</li>
                                    <li> A sore throat that persists for a prolonged period</li>
                                    <li> A lump or an ulcer on the tongue that does not go away</li>
                                    <li> Pain when swallowing</li>
                                    <li> Numbness in the mouth</li>
                                    <li> Bleeding from the tongue</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>In the case of buccal mucosal cancer, no symptoms appear in the early stages. The
                                    following are the symptoms that occur in later stages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Red or white lump in the mouth that persists after two weeks</li>
                                    <li> A raised red patch in the mouth that bleeds easily</li>
                                    <li> Soreness in the throat or a feeling that something is caught</li>
                                    <li> A lump in the mouth</li>
                                    <li> Increased pain when eating or drinking</li>
                                    <li> Numbness in the tongue or other areas of the mouth</li>
                                    <li> Difficulty chewing or swallowing</li>
                                    <li> Hoarseness</li>
                                    <li> Difficulty moving the jaw or tongue</li>
                                    <li> Severe ear pain</li>
                                    <li> Loose teeth or pain around teeth</li>
                                    <li> Swelling in the jaw that causes poor fitting of the dentures</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>The tests and procedures given below are used to detect and diagnose tongue and
                                    buccal mucosa cancer:</p><br>
                                <p><b> Physical exam:</b> Inside the mouth and back of the throat are examined by the
                                    doctor to check the location and size of the tumor. The nose, ears, and neck may
                                    also be examined to know if the tumor has spread to the nearby tissues and organs.
                                </p><br>
                                <p><b>Fine needle aspiration biopsy:</b> For this procedure, a thin needle is placed in
                                    the mouth and the cells are suctioned. These cells are examined under a microscope
                                    to check if the lump is cancerous.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Computerized tomography (CT) scan:</b> An X-ray machine is connected to a computer
                                    that creates a series of images of areas inside the mouth and neck. Sometimes, a
                                    pill may be given, or a dye may be injected to highlight the tissue on the X-ray.
                                </p><br>
                                <p><b>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):</b> In this procedure, a large magnet, radio
                                    waves, and a computer are used to produce detailed pictures of the inside of the
                                    mouth and neck.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Positron emission tomography (PET) scan:</b> During the scan, a small amount of
                                    radioactive substance is injected into a vein, which is absorbed more by the cancer
                                    cells than the normal cells. The scanner generates images of the areas inside the
                                    mouth and neck.</p><br>
                                <h3>Stages of tongue and buccal mucosa cancer:</h3>
                                <p>The following are the basic stages of tongue and buccal mucosa cancer:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Stage 0:</b> Anormal cells in the lining of the buccal cavity and tongue.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b> Stage I:</b> Tumor not > 2cm and has not spread to the lymph nodes.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage II:</b> Tumor is >2 cm but &gt; 4 cm and has not spread to the lymph
                                        nodes.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage III:</b> Cancer is >4 cm or has spread to the lymph node in the neck.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b> Stage IV:</b> Tumour can be of any size and has spread to nearby tissues,
                                        such as the jaw and other parts, one or multiple lymph nodes, or distant organs
                                        of the body, such as the lungs.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Tongue Cancer Treatment</h3>
                                <p>The treatment aims to cure cancer, retain the function and appearance of the mouth,
                                    and prevent cancer from recurring.</p><br>
                                <p>Tongue and buccal mucosa cancer can be treated successfully if diagnosed early. The
                                    treatment involves either surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. The treatment method
                                    depends on the stage of cancer and the extent of the spread of cancer. A combination
                                    of treatments may be used for advanced cancers.</p><br>
                                <h3>Surgery</h3>
                                <p>The small tumors are removed from the buccal mucosa by using a scalpel. The incision
                                    size depends on the size of the tumor. If the tumor is small, an incision through
                                    the cheek will not be needed.</p><br>
                                <p>To remove the tumors of the tongue, a glossectomy is performed. This technique
                                    involves removing a part (partial glossectomy) or entire (complete glossectomy)
                                    tongue based on the size of the tumor.</p><br>
                                <p>In case the lymph nodes are also affected, they will also be removed during the
                                    surgery.</p><br>
                                <p>Reconstruction surgery may be performed to restore the part of the tongue or the
                                    cheek that is removed. A flap of skin and/or tissues underlying the skin may be
                                    taken for reconstruction.</p><br>
                                <p>Before and after the surgery, the patient may have to consult a speech and swallowing
                                    expert to design a customized rehabilitation program to maintain the functions as
                                    much as possible.</p><br>
                                <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
                                <p>Chemotherapy involves administering certain drugs which circulate in the blood and
                                    interrupt the growth of cancer cells. These medicines are either given orally or
                                    intravenously over some time.</p><br>
                                <p>Chemotherapy can be recommended to reduce the growth of the tumor. It can be combined
                                    with surgery to control growth and symptoms, and after surgery to decrease the
                                    chance of cancer recurrence.</p><br>
                                <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3>
                                <p>Radiation therapy involves delivering high-energy beams to the tumor, which damage
                                    the DNA and destroy the cancer cells. The dose, time, and frequency of radiation
                                    therapy are customized according to each case. This method delivers radiation
                                    precisely to the tumor while protecting the healthy cells in the mouth.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                                <p>Generally, the outlook for tongue and buccal mucosa cancer depends on the stage and
                                    location of the tumor. The survival rate is high when the tumor is diagnosed at an
                                    early stage. However, other factors also affect the survival rate, which include,
                                    the age of the patient, tobacco usage, overall health, and the presence of human
                                    papillomavirus infection. The best prognostic factor for intraoral cancers and lip
                                    carcinomas is tumor staging.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/bladdercancer.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>The bladder is a hollow, muscular, pear-shaped organ situated in the pelvic cavity.
                                    It acts as a temporary reservoir for urine storage.</p><br>
                                <p>Bladder cancer usually begins when the cells lining the bladder begin to grow
                                    abnormally. According to GLOBOCAN data, bladder cancer accounts for 3% of global
                                    cancer diagnoses. Globally, it is the 10th most common cancer and the incidence is
                                    increasing consistently, especially in developing countries.</p><br>
                                <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Blood in the urine is the most common symptom of bladder cancer. But, sometimes the
                                    blood may come and go, or it may turn the urine into dark brown colour, which makes
                                    it difficult to notice this symptom.</p><br>
                                <p>Few other bladder cancer symptoms during the initial stage might include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Burning sensation while urination</li>
                                    <li>Increased frequency of urination</li>
                                    <li>Urgency to urinate</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <p>In the advanced stage, bladder cancer may cause the following symptoms:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Blood loss</li>
                                    <li>Bone pain</li>
                                    <li>Lower back pain</li>
                                    <li>Pelvic pain</li>
                                    <li>Swelling of the legs</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <p>In cases, when bladder cancer has metastasized to bone, liver or lungs, symptoms
                                    related to specific organs are also noticed.</p><br>
                                <h3>Causes and Risk Factors</h3>
                                <p>The exact cause of bladder cancer is still unknown. However, researchers believe that
                                    bladder cancer occurs when there is a sudden change in the DNA of the bladder cells.
                                    These changes may either turn on the oncogenes or turn off the tumour suppressor
                                    genes, which can result in an uncontrollable growth and division of the cells. These
                                    changes are influenced by several factors, and include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Smoking:</b> The risk of bladder cancer is three times more in smokers.</li>
                                    <li><b>Exposure to chemicals:</b> Chemicals released while manufacturing rubber,
                                        dyes, leather, and paint products affect the lining of the urinary bladder and
                                        may result in bladder cancer.</li>
                                    <li><b>Gender:</b> Men are at higher risk of bladder cancer than women.</li>
                                    <li><b>Age:</b> Bladder cancer can happen at any age, but its risk increases with
                                        advancing age.</li>
                                    <li><b>Medications:</b> Studies reveal that the usage of anti-diabetic medications
                                        (pioglitazone) and cancer therapies (especially chemotherapy) for more than one
                                        year may increase the risk of bladder cancer.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>The patient’s medical history and family history are reviewed. In women, a pelvic or
                                    digital rectal examination is done by inserting a gloved and lubricated finger in
                                    the rectum to feel the tumour in the bladder.</p><br>
                                <p>A urinalysis may help to check if there are any traces of blood. Additionally, urine
                                    cytology is done to check for any abnormal cells that may be shed from the bladder
                                    lining. The following are some tests done to detect the stage and any abnormalities
                                    in the surrounding organs:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Cystoscopy:</b> In this procedure, a small cystoscope (a thin flexible tube
                                        with a video camera mounted at one end) is inserted through the urethra. The
                                        camera transmits real-time images of the bladder lining.</li>
                                    <li><b>Biopsy:</b> A biopsy can be done along with cystoscopy. The procedure
                                        involves inserting a needle or other special tools through the cystoscope to
                                        collect and examine the sample of tumour tissue.</li>
                                    <li><b>Imaging tests:</b> Tests such as computerized tomography (CT) scan,
                                        pyelogram, ultrasound, and MRI are done to examine the structures in the urinary
                                        tract.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Stages of bladder cancer:</h3>
                                <p>The cancer staging is important to determine the severity of cancer, its size and
                                    extent, and to devise an appropriate treatment plan.</p><br>
                                <p>Bladder cancer can have the following stages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Stage 0:</b> Cancer cells are located on the surface of the inner lining of
                                        the bladder.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage I:</b> Cancer has spread to the connective tissue beneath the inner
                                        lining of the bladder.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage II:</b> Cancer has spread to the muscular wall of the bladder, but
                                        hasn’t reached the fatty tissue surrounding the bladder, lymph nodes, and other
                                        organs.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage III:</b> Cancer has grown through the muscle layer of the bladder and
                                        has spread into the prostate, seminal vesicles, uterus, or vagina.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IV:</b> Cancer has spread from the bladder to the distant parts of the
                                        body, such as bone, lung, or liver.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b>Bladder Cancer Treatment:</b> Once the bladder cancer is diagnosed, you and your
                                    treatment team will discuss the treatment options, its benefits, possible risks and
                                    side effects. The treatment for bladder cancer is based on the stage of cancer
                                    during the time of diagnosis. Treatment modalities for bladder cancer include:</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Bladder Cancer Surgery:</b> Surgery is an appropriate treatment option for all
                                    stages of bladder cancer. Depending upon the patient’s age, stage of cancer, and
                                    side effects of the surgery, any of the following types of surgery may be
                                    recommended:</p> <br>

                                <h3>Transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT)</h3>
                                <p>TURBT is a common early-stage, non-invasive treatment option to remove bladder
                                    cancers confined to the inner layers of the bladder. It is performed under general
                                    anaesthesia. Once the anaesthesia sets in, a small wire loop is passed through a
                                    cystoscope (thin tube fitted with a camera) into the bladder. Through this wire
                                    loop, an electric current is passed to burn and destroy the cancer cells.</p> <br>

                                <h3>Cystectomy</h3>
                                <p>This procedure involves the removal of all or a part of the bladder. It is of two
                                    types: Radical and partial.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Partial cystectomy is performed when the tumour is limited to one area of the
                                        bladder and can be easily removed. This procedure involves the removal of only
                                        the portion of the bladder that contains the tumour.</li>
                                    <li>Radical cystectomy involves removal of the entire bladder, part of the
                                        reproductive organs (uterus or prostate) and surrounding lymph nodes. It is
                                        recommended when the tumour invades and spreads to larger parts of the bladder.
                                    </li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Urinary diversion:</h3>
                                <p>It is a surgical procedure that reroutes the normal urine flow. This procedure is
                                    done when the urine flow is blocked due to the formation of tumours.</p> <br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> It is a treatment option that involves the use of specific drugs
                                    to
                                    kill or stop the growth of cancer cells. These drugs interfere with the process of
                                    cell division and promote cancer cell death. Chemotherapy is recommended either
                                    before the surgery to shrink a tumour (neoadjuvant therapy) or after the surgery/
                                    radiation therapy to kill the remaining cancer cells (adjuvant therapy).</p> <br>
                                <p>Chemotherapy for bladder cancer can be given in 2 different ways:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Intravesical chemotherapy: From a tube passed through the urethra directly to
                                        the bladder</li>
                                    <li>Intravenous chemotherapy: Through a vein in the arm</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b> It involves the use of high energy radiation beams to
                                    shrink and destroy the tumour. It can be given alone or in combination with
                                    chemotherapy or surgery.</p><br>
                                <p>Radiation therapy is a localised treatment option that can be given in two ways i.e.
                                    externally through an external source or internally by placing radioactive pellets
                                    near the tumour. External radiation therapy is mostly preferred for bladder cancers.
                                </p><br>
                                <p><b>Immunotherapy:</b> It involves the use of substances derived from living
                                    organisms, which can fight against cancer. Immunotherapy works by either recognizing
                                    or attacking cancer cells or by boosting the natural defence mechanism of the immune
                                    system. Immunotherapy is rarely recommended for bladder cancer.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prevention:</h3>
                                <p>There is no specific way to prevent bladder cancer. However, certain measures can
                                    help you lower the risk of bladder cancer. These include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Smoking cessation</li>
                                    <li>Following safety practices, if your work involves exposure to chemicals</li>
                                    <li>Drinking a lot of fluids, especially water</li>
                                    <li>Eating fresh fruits and vegetables</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Outlook:</h3>
                                <p>The prognosis depends on the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis. The relative
                                    5-year survival rate for localized bladder cancer is 70%, regional bladder cancer is
                                    36%, and distant bladder cancer is 5% respectively.</p><br>

                                <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), lung cancer is the leading cause of
                                    cancer deaths worldwide in men, while breast cancer is the leading cause of death in
                                    women. [1,2] Since 2008, worldwide breast cancer incidence has increased and it
                                    affects around 2.1 million women every year. [2] Studies showed that in every four
                                    minutes, a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, globally. As per the Indian
                                    Council of Medical Research (ICMR) data, around 1, 00,000 new breast cancer patients
                                    are diagnosed every year in India. [3,4]</p><br>

                                <p>Breasts are made up of three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissues
                                    (which consists of fibrous and fatty tissue). Lobules are the glands that produce
                                    milk, while ducts are thin tubes that carry milk to the nipple. The connective
                                    tissue provides support and holds everything together in shape.</p><br>
                                <p>Breast cancer is caused by abnormal growth and division of cells in the breast. They
                                    can begin either in the cells of the lobules or ducts. Breast cancer mostly occur in
                                    women, but men can also get breast cancer.</p><br>
                                <p>Breast cancers are of different types and the common ones include ductal carcinoma in
                                    situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma. Other less common types of breast cancer are
                                    Paget’s disease, phyllodes tumors, angiosarcoma and inflammatory breast cancer.</p>

                                <p>The most common symptom of breast cancer is a new soft lump or mass in the breast or
                                    underarm. Additionally, it may also cause:</p>
                                <ul>

                                    <li> Pain in the breast region</li>
                                    <li> Inverted nipple</li>
                                    <li> Change in the nipple or breast skin</li>
                                    <li> Irritation or dimpling of the breast skin</li>
                                    <li> Nipple discharge other than the breast milk</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Causes and Risk Factors</h3>
                                <p>The exact cause of breast cancer is not clear. However, some of the following factors
                                    may increase the risk of developing breast cancer:</p><br>
                                <h3>Non-modifiable risk factors:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Women gender</li>

                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Breast cancer diagnosis is necessary when suspicious lumps or nodules shows up during
                                    a clinical or self-examination. Initially, the symptoms, medical history, and family
                                    history of the patient are reviewed. A physical examination is done to identify
                                    lumps or variations in the breasts.</p><br>
                                <p>To confirm the diagnosis, following tests are recommended.</p><br>
                                <h3>Imaging tests</h3>
                                <p>Imaging tests help to diagnose the stage and extent of breast cancer. These tests
                                    include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Mammograms:</b> Mammograms are low-dose x-rays that are used to screen
                                        breast canc•. It helps in diagnosing and locating the lumps and any other breast
                                        abnormalities.</li>
                                    <li><b> Breast ultrasound:</b> It uses sound waves to create internal images of
                                        breasts, •owing any lumps or abnormalities. It helps to distinguish between a
                                        solid mass, which may be cancer and a non-cancerous fluid-filled cyst.</li>
                                    <li><b> Breast MRI:</b> It uses powerful magnetic fields to create images of the
                                        breast.•t helps in identifying breast lumps that are not visible with other
                                        imaging tests especially in women with dense breast tissue.</li>
                                    <li><b> Scintimammography: </b>It is a type of nuclear medicine imaging test that
                                        helps•etermine the extent of breast cancer that has already been diagnosed. It
                                        also helps to decide whether a biopsy or additional follow-up tests are
                                        necessary.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Biopsy</h3>
                                <p>A sample of breast tissue is collected and examined in laboratory to determine any
                                    abnormalities. There are different kinds of biopsies based on the technique used to
                                    collect the tissue sample, such as fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, open biopsy
                                    etc.</p><br>
                                <h3>Stages of breast cancer:</h3>
                                <p>The cancer staging is done using TNM system. It provides detailed information about:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Tumour (T):</b> Whether the primary tumour has grown through the breast</li>
                                    <li><b> Node (N):</b> Whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes surrounding
                                        the breast</li>
                                    <li><b> Metastasis (M):</b> Whether the cancer has spread to distant parts of the
                                        body.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Based on the TNM staging, breast cancer has the following stages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Stage 0a/0is:</b> Cancer cells are located only in the ducts of the breast
                                        tissue and have not spread to the surrounding tissue of the breast.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage I:</b> Tumors are either small, invasive, and have not spread to the
                                        lymph nodes or if have spread to the lymph nodes and the cancer in the lymph
                                        node is larger than 0.2 mm in size.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage II:</b> Tumors are between 20-50mm in size and may have spread to the
                                        axiliary lymph nodes or a tumor larger than 50mm and no lymph nodes are
                                        involved.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage III:</b> Tumor is larger than 50mm and has spread to 4 to 9 axiliary
                                        lymph nodes or to internal mammary lymph nodes. It may have spread to chest wall
                                        or skin.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage IV:</b> The tumor can be any size and has spread to distant parts of
                                        the body like lung, liver, and bones.</li>

                                <h3>Treatment for breast cancer</h3>
                                <p>The main aim of the treatment is to remove as much as cancer possible and to prevent
                                    the recurrence. Based on the type, size, and extent of cancer, the treatment team
                                    will recommend the following treatment option:</p><br>
                                <h3>Breast cancer surgery:</h3>
                                <p>The surgery involves removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue. It is
                                    mainly recommended for early stage cancer with smaller tumor.</p><br>
                                <p>Types of surgery include the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Lumpectomy:</b> The tumor and some surrounding tissue is removed while
                                        leaving the rest of the breast intact. For invasive cancer, radiation therapy is
                                        recommended after the surgery to remove the remaining cancer cells.</li>
                                    <li><b> Mastectomy:</b> It involves removal of all the breast tissue. In some cases,
                                        double mastectomy is required, in which both breasts are removed.</li>
                                    <li><b> Sentinel node biopsy:</b> This procedure involves locating the sentinel
                                        lymph nodes and their removal. These nodes are sent to the laboratory for
                                        further examination. This procedure is recommended if the cancer has spread
                                        beyond the primary tumour.</li>
                                    <li><b> Axillary lymph node dissection:</b> It involves removal of lymph nodes from
                                        the armpit. This procedure is recommended if one or more sentinel lymph nodes
                                        contain cancer.</li>
                                    <li><b> Breast reconstruction:</b> It is done to rebuild the shape of breast after
                                        mastectomy.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Radiation therapy:</h3>
                                <p>It involves delivering high-energy radiation beams to shrink and destroy tumors. It
                                    can be administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy or after surgical
                                    procedures, such as a lumpectomy or mastectomy. Radiation therapy is a preferred
                                    treatment option in stage-4 breast cancer.</p><br>
                                <h3>Chemotherapy:</h3>
                                <p>It uses specific drugs to kill or stop the growth of cancer cells. These drugs
                                    interfere with the process of cell division and promote cancer cell death. In breast
                                    cancer, chemotherapy is recommended before the surgery to shrink a tumour or after
                                    the surgery/ radiation therapy to kill remaining cancer cells. It is also
                                    recommended to control the spread during the advanced stage.</p><br>
                                <h3>Hormone therapy:</h3>
                                <p>It is recommended to treat breast cancers that are sensitive to hormones, such as
                                    estrogen or progesterone. This therapy acts by reducing the production of hormones
                                    or blocks them from working. Thus, it helps prevent a cancer recurrence. Hormonal
                                    therapy may be given before or after the surgery to shrink a tumor and to lower the
                                    risk of recurrence.</p><br>
                                <h3>Targeted Therapy:</h3>
                                <p>It uses specific drugs or substances to destroy cancer by targeting specific
                                    characteristic of cancer cells. Targeted therapy is recommended in patients whose
                                    breast cancer cells overexpress certain characteristic of proteins on cancer cell
                                    surface, thereby allowing the abnormal growth pattern.</p><br>
                                <h3>Immunotherapy:</h3>
                                <p>It uses certain medicines to boost a person’s immune system to find and destroy the
                                    cancer cells. Atezolizumab and pembrolizumab are among the few drugs approved for
                                    breast cancer treatment.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                                <p>Even though, breast cancer being the most diagnosed cancer in women, there is no
                                    proven way to completely prevent it. A routine screening and self-examination are
                                    the key for early diagnosis and better prognosis.</p><br>
                                <h3>Breast self-examination</h3>
                                <p>Perform self-examination every month, usually two weeks after menstrual period to
                                    check for any lumps or tender areas or any abnormal changes in the size or texture
                                    of breasts.</p><br>
                                <h3>Breast cancer screening</h3>
                                <p>Mammography is the best tool to screen healthy women for breast cancer. It is an
                                    imaging technique that uses low doses of X-rays to detect any lumps that cannot be
                                    felt during a physical examination.</p><br>
                                <p>In addition to the above measures, the following options may help in reducing your
                                    risk of breast cancer:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Practicing a healthy lifestyle and eating habits</li>
                                    <li> Limiting alcohol</li>
                                    <li> Smoking cessation</li>
                                    <li> Conceiving early</li>
                                    <li> Breastfeeding, if possible</li>
                                    <li> Avoiding birth control pills, particularly after the age of 35 years</li>

                                <p>Although there is no way to prevent breast cancers, proper diagnosis and treatment
                                    may reduce its risk. Follow-up care and positive attitude throughout the treatment
                                    will help in better outcomes.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/coloncancer.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Do you know in the recent decade more young people have developed colon and rectal
                                    cancer? According to studies, millennials have double the risk of colon and four
                                    times more risk of rectal cancer when compared to people born in the 1950s. This
                                    trend has raised several questions about the lifestyle, environmental factors, and
                                    screening techniques for colorectal cancer (CRC). Till now, it is not clear why
                                    people, especially younger than 50 years get CRC. Keeping these facts in mind, the
                                    biggest focus is on preventing, detecting and treating CRC as early as possible.</p>

                                <h3>Colon and Rectal Cancer</h3>
                                <p>Colon and rectal cancers are abnormal growths in the colon and the rectum (parts of
                                    the lower region of the digestive system). These cancers have many common features,
                                    so they are usually grouped as colorectal cancer.</p><br>
                                <p>Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common
                                    in women, globally. (1) In India, colon cancer is the eighth most common in men and
                                    ninth most common in women, whereas rectal cancer is in the ninth position in men
                                    and it doesn’t figure in the top 10 cancer in women. (2)</p><br>
                                <p>According to World Health Organisation, about 36,687 men and 20,064 women were newly
                                    diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2018. Also, 20,056 people died of rectal cancer
                                    and 19,548 died of colon cancer.</p><br>
                                <h3>Colorectal Cancer Causes and Risk Factors</h3>
                                <p>Colorectal cancer occurs when the cells lining the colon or the rectum begin to grow
                                    and divide abnormally, resulting in the formation of a mass of tissue, known as a
                                    polyp. Not all polyps are cancerous, only some that continue to grow may become
                                    cancerous. The cancerous cells in the polyps may invade the other tissues and lymph
                                    nodes and metastasize to distant parts of the body.</p><br>
                                <p>The exact cause of colorectal cancer is not yet unknown. However, the following may
                                    increase the risk factors for colorectal cancer:</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Non-modifiable risk factors:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Age</li>

                                <h3>Modifiable Risk Factors:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Diet rich in refined and processed foods</li>
                                    <li>Physical inactivity</li>

                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer:</h3>
                                <p>CRC usually doesn’t cause any signs or symptoms immediately. But, if it does, then it
                                    might cause the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Incomplete bowel emptying</li>
                                    <li>Narrower stools than usual</li>
                                    <li>Loose stools or constipation</li>
                                    <li>Blood in stools or rectal bleeding</li>
                                    <li>Abdominal pain/ cramps</li>
                                    <li>Bloating</li>
                                    <li>Frequent flatulence</li>
                                    <li>Tiredness</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p> Visit a doctor immediately, if these symptoms persist for more than two weeks.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Screening for CRC:</h3>
                                <p>Regular screening is the only way to detect and beat CRC during the early stages.
                                    According to recent American Cancer Society guidelines, a person with an average
                                    risk of CRC must begin screening at 45 years and proceed until 75 years. After the
                                    first screening, the person is advised to have a screening every ten years.</p><br>
                                <p>People with a high risk of CRC must start screening before the age of 45 and should
                                    get screened more often.</p><br>
                                <h3>Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis:</h3>
                                <p>Diagnosing CRC during the early stages improves the survival rate to about 90%.
                                    Initially, the patient’s history, including the information about the incidence of
                                    symptoms, family history of CRC or polyps, and personal medical history is
                                    collected. Later, a physical examination and a digital rectal examination are done.
                                </p><br>
                                <p><b>Physical examination:</b> It is performed to examine the abdomen and other parts
                                    of the body to detect any enlarged organs or abnormal masses.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Digital rectal examination:</b> It is performed by inserting a lubricated, gloved
                                    finger in the rectum to detect the presence of any abnormal masses.</p><br>
                                <p>If the doctor suspects colorectal cancer then the following diagnostic tests are
                                    recommended:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Colonoscopy:</b> It is performed both as a screening and confirmatory test for
                                    CRC. This test involves the insertion of a colonoscope (a thin, long, tube-like
                                    instrument with a light, outlet for air, and camera) into the colon and the rectum
                                    to view any abnormalities.</p><br>
                                <p><b>CT Colonography:</b> A colonoscope is inserted into the patient’s colon and the
                                    air is passed to inflate the colon. The patient is now passed through the CT
                                    scanner, which takes multiple and detailed images of the colon and the rectum.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Stool tests:</b> Stool samples are collected and examined to determine any
                                    abnormal signs of colorectal cancer. Faecal immunochemical test (FIT) or
                                    Immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT), Guaiac-based faecal occult blood
                                    test (gFOBT), and stool DNA test are some stool tests employed for diagnosing CRC.
                                </p><br>
                                <p><b>Flexible Sigmoidoscopy:</b> In this test, a sigmoidoscope (a thin, flexible,
                                    lighted tube fitted with a video camera) is inserted into the rectum and passed to
                                    the lower part of the colon to detect polyps or cancer.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Biopsy:</b> If abnormalities are found in any of the diagnostic tests, a biopsy is
                                    advised. In this test, special surgical tools are passed inside the colon or rectum
                                    to collect a tissue sample. This tissue is further examined in the laboratory.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Blood test:</b> People with CRC may experience bleeding that may result in
                                    anaemia. Additionally, it helps in determining the health of the kidney and the
                                    liver. A blood test might also be done to detect the presence of a chemical known as
                                    carcinoembryonic antigen, which might indicate CRC.</p><br>
                                <h3>Staging of CRC:</h3>
                                <p>Staging of cancer helps to know about the severity, size, extent and spread of
                                    cancer. The stage of CRC are as follows:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Stage I:</b> Cancer has grown through the inner lining and entered into the
                                        muscular layer of the colon or rectum.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IIA:</b> Cancer has grown into the colorectal wall.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IIB:</b> Cancer has grown through the muscular layer of the colon and
                                        the rectum and extended to the lining of the abdomen.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IIC:</b> The tumour has spread through the colon or rectal walls and
                                        has invaded nearby structures.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IIIA:</b> Cancer has grown through the walls of the colon or rectum. It
                                        has spread to 1 to 3 lymph nodes or forms a tumour nodule in tissues around the
                                        colon or rectum.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IIIB:</b> Cancer has grown through the wall of the colon/ rectum or to
                                        surrounding organs. It has spread to 1 to 3 lymph nodes or forms a nodule of
                                        tumour in tissues around the colon or rectum that do not appear to be lymph
                                        nodes.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IIIC:</b> Cancer has grown through the wall of the colon/ rectum. It
                                        has spread to 4 or more lymph nodes.</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage IV:</b> Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Treatment:</h3>
                                <p>Colorectal cancer treatment depends on the location and stage of cancer. Also, the
                                    patient’s age, medical history, and overall health condition are considered.</p><br>
                                <p>Treatment modalities for CRC include:</p><br>
                                <h3>Colorectal Cancer Surgery:</h3>
                                <p>Surgery is the common treatment option for all stages of CRC. Surgery is done to
                                    remove the tumours and surrounding tissues where cancer might have spread. Depending
                                    on the location and stage of cancer the doctor might recommend any of the following
                                    surgeries:</p><br>
                                <h3>Colon cancer surgeries:</h3>

                                <p>Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. It is either given orally or
                                    in the form of an intravenous injection. Chemotherapy is usually given after the
                                    surgery to prevent the recurrence of cancer or before the surgery to shrink the
                                    tumour.</p><br>
                                <h3>Radiation therapy:</h3>
                                <p>It involves the usage of high-energy beams to shrink and destroy cancer cells.
                                    Radiation therapy is usually combined with surgery/chemotherapy. For colorectal
                                    cancer, radiotherapy is usually used to target rectal cancers than colon cancers.

                                <p>It involves the administration of certain medicines to block the growth and spread of
                                    cancer cells. Targeted therapy acts by inhibiting the action of specific molecules,
                                    enzymes, or proteins that are responsible for the growth and progression of cancer.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>Immunotherapy:</h3>
                                <p>Immunotherapy boosts the body’s natural defence system against cancer. It involves
                                    the use of substances derived or made from living organisms. Immunotherapy acts by
                                    recognizing and attacking cancer cells or by boosting the function of immune cells.

                                <h3>Prevention of Colorectal Cancer</h3>
                                <p>Cancer prevention has always been a top objective, but the promise of cancer
                                    prevention remains unfulfilled. However, there are a few approaches that help in
                                    lowering the risk of colorectal cancer. These include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Getting screened regularly</li>
                                    <li>Maintaining a healthy body weight</li>
                                    <li>Exercising regularly</li>
                                    <li>Eating a healthy diet</li>
                                    <li>Avoiding alcohol consumption</li>
                                    <li>Smoking cessation</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Outlook:</h3>
                                <p>Recent evidence has changed our understanding of cancer, its biology, and the complex
                                    interaction of risk factors. The desired actions are always clear and simple to
                                    state, but execution always remains a formidable challenge. One can overcome this,
                                    by moving beyond the challenges and taking necessary actions to reduce the global
                                    burden of cancer.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/larynx.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Larynx cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. It is the 9th most common type of
                                    cancer in India. In 2018, 28,721 new cases of larynx cancer were reported in India.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>The larynx is the part between the base of the tongue and the trachea, which is made
                                    up of cartilages. It contains the vocal cords, which vibrate and produce sounds, and
                                    help to speak. The larynx also helps to breathe and swallow. There are three parts
                                    of the larynx- the upper part of the supraglottis, the middle part of the glottis,
                                    and the lower part of the subglottis.</p><br>
                                <p>Approximately 35% of laryngeal cancers begin in the supraglottis, 60% in the glottis,
                                    and only 5% in the subglottis.</p><br>
                                <h3>About larynx cancer</h3>
                                <p>Larynx cancer is a rare type of head and neck cancer, which occurs in the larynx or
                                    the voice box. Cancer is a rapid, uncontrollable growth of cells that causes damage
                                    to the body. Usually, laryngeal cancers occur in the squamous cells, the cells that
                                    line the inside of the larynx. In the later stages, cancer may spread to nearby
                                    tissues or organs such as the trachea, thyroid, esophagus, lymph nodes in the neck,
                                    upper part of the spinal column, and other parts of the body.</p><br>
                                <h3>Laryngeal Cancer Causes/Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>The exact cause of larynx cancer is not known. However, several factors increase the
                                    risk of larynx cancer. These factors include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Age over 55 years old</li>
                                    <li>Male gender (they have five times more risk than women)</li>
                                    <li>Personal or family history of head and neck cancer</li>
                                    <li>Smoking tobacco and other products</li>
                                    <li>Having large amounts of alcohol</li>

                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>The tests discussed below can help diagnose larynx cancer:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Physical exam:</b> The neck is examined to check for any abnormal signs of larynx
                                    cancer. A gloved finger can be used to examine the insides of the mouth and throat.
                                </p><br>
                                <p><b>Laryngoscopy:</b> It is a procedure in which a thin, tube-like instrument with a
                                    light and a lens (laryngoscope) is inserted into the throat via the mouth. A tool
                                    may be used to remove the sample tissue, which is then examined under the
                                    microscope.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Biopsy:</b> A small piece of the larynx is removed to be examined under the
                                    microscope.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Computed tomography (CT) scan:</b> In this procedure, a series of cross-sectional
                                    images of the areas inside the body are produced using X-rays. In larynx cancer, it
                                    is done to determine the extent of cancer.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):</b> In this test, clear images of various parts
                                    of the body are obtained using radio waves, a large magnet, and a computer. An MRI
                                    scan is recommended when a CT scan is not able to provide all the necessary
                                    information about larynx cancer.</p><br>
                                <p><b>PET scan:</b> In this method, a very small dose of a radioactive chemical is
                                    injected into a vein, which is absorbed by the organs and tissues. A scanner
                                    produces three-dimensional images from the energy released by the radioactive
                                    substance. This scan is recommended to get detailed cancer information.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Bone scan:</b> This scan is recommended when any signs that cancer has spread to
                                    bones are noticed. In this procedure, a very small amount of a radioactive chemical
                                    is injected into a vein, which gets collected in the bones with cancer and can be
                                    detected by a scanner.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Barium swallow:</b> This test is recommended to examine irregularities in
                                    different regions of the throat.</p><br>
                                <h3>Stages of Larynx Cancer:</h3>
                                <p>The following are the stages of larynx cancer:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>Stage I:</b> Cancer is formed in the supraglottis, glottis, or subglottis of
                                        the larynx and the vocal cords work normally.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage II:</b>
                                        Supraglottis: Cancer is formed in one or more areas of supraglottis or has
                                        spread to the tissues near the vocal cords or the base of the tongue. The vocal
                                        cords function normally.
                                        Glottis: Cancer has spread to the subglottis, supraglottis, or both, and/or
                                        vocal cords do not function normally.
                                        Subglottis: Cancer has spread to one or both vocal cords; vocal cords may not
                                        function normally.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage III:</b> Cancer may be formed in more than one area, or may have
                                        spread through the thyroid cartilage, or may have spread to one or both vocal
                                        cords, may have spread to one lymph node (&lt;3cm in size) on the same side of
                                        the
                                        neck as the primary tumor, vocal cords may or may not work normally.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stage IV:</b> This stage is categorized into three substages based
                                        on whether cancer has spread to nearby tissues such as the trachea, thyroid,
                                        esophagus, or neck; cancer has spread to lymph nodes (&lt;3c cancer m or>3cm
                                        and &lt;6cm or>6cm in size) on the same side of the neck as the primary
                                        tumor; they has spread through the outside covering of the lymph
                                        node; the vocal cords may not work normally, and whether cancer has
                                        spread to other parts of the body, such as the bones, lungs, or
                                        liver.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Laryngeal Cancer Treatment</h3>
                                <p>There are different types of treatment available for patients with larynx cancer.
                                    These include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery. A combination of these
                                    methods can be used for appropriate patients. Doctors may suggest any clinical trial
                                    if it appears to be more promising than the before mentioned methods.</p><br>
                                <h3>Radiation therapy</h3>
                                <p>During radiation therapy, high-energy X-rays are delivered to kill the cancer cells.
                                    To treat larynx cancer, hypofractionated radiation may be used. In this type of
                                    radiation treatment, a less than usual total daily dose of radiation is divided into
                                    two doses and given two times a day. This radiation is given at the same time as the
                                    standard radiation therapy.</p><br>
                                <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
                                <p>Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells.
                                    When the drugs are given, they enter the bloodstream and reach the cancer cells
                                    throughout the body. These drugs are usually given intravenously.</p><br>
                                <h3>Surgery</h3>
                                <p>Surgery can be recommended for all stages of larynx cancer. When performed in the
                                    early stage of cancer, surgery aims to take out cancer without removing the entire
                                    larynx and protect the major functions of the larynx. For advanced-stage cancers,
                                    the larynx is removed completely (laryngectomy).</p><br>
                                <p>Below are some of the surgical procedures used to treat larynx cancer. The most
                                    appropriate approach will be selected for each patient.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Cordectomy:</b> Only the vocal cords are removed.</li>
                                    <li><b>Supraglottic laryngectomy:</b> Only the carcinoma supraglottis is removed.
                                    </li>

                                    <li><b>Total laryngectomy:</b> The whole larynx is removed. A hole is made in the
                                        front of the neck for easy breathing (tracheostomy).</li>

                                </ul><br>
                                <p>After the cancer is removed, some patients may be given radiation or chemotherapy to
                                    kill the remaining cancer cells (if any). These treatments can also be given to
                                    reduce the recurrence of cancer; it is called adjuvant therapy.</p><br>
                                <h3>Immunotherapy</h3>
                                <p>Immunotherapy involves using the patient's immune system to fight cancer. The
                                    substances produced by the body or made in the laboratory can direct, boost or
                                    restore the natural defense against cancer. For treating larynx cancer, immune
                                    checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab can be used.</p><br>
                                <h3>Outlook</h3>
                                <p>The prognosis of a patient depends on the stage, location, size, and grade of the
                                    tumor, the patient’s age, gender, and general health. Cancers found in the early
                                    stage have a greater cure rate than those found in the late stage. Cancers that have
                                    invaded other areas of the body have a poor survival rate. After being diagnosed
                                    with larynx cancer, one must stop smoking, as it can improve the prognosis.
                                    Continuing to smoke after treatment can increase the risk of cancer recurrence,
                                    delay the healing process, worsen the side effects of the treatment, and prevent the
                                    patient’s voice from recovering completely.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/multiplemyeloma.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer, with substantial morbidity
                                    and mortality. According to Globocan 2018, about 159,985 new cases were diagnosed,
                                    and the disease was responsible for 106, 105 deaths globally.</p><br>
                                <h3>Overview</h3>
                                <p>Multiple myeloma refers to the cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell
                                    predominantly found in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. They secrete large
                                    quantities of proteins, known as antibodies, against pathogens or the toxins
                                    released by them.</p><br>
                                <p>Our immune system is made up of several types of cells that defend our body against
                                    potent pathogens. B cells are one of the subtypes of lymphocytes, a major type of
                                    white blood cell (WBCs). During an infection, the B cells differentiate into plasma
                                    cells that make antibodies to fight against pathogens. Plasma cells are
                                    predominantly found in the bone marrow, and soft tissue inside bones, acting as a
                                    source for red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets.</p><br>
                                <p>During multiple myeloma, the plasma cells become cancerous and grow uncontrollably to
                                    build up in bone marrow and crowd out the healthy cells. These plasma cells make
                                    abnormal protein known as M protein, higher levels of which can lead to many
                                    complications. A high level of M protein in the blood is also noted as a hallmark of
                                    multiple myeloma.</p><br>
                                <p>Multiple myeloma is not limited to a specific bone or location within the bone but is
                                    likely to involve the entire skeleton. However, when only one single lesion occurs,
                                    it is known as plasmacytoma.</p><br>
                                <h3>Causes of multiple myeloma</h3>
                                <p>The exact cause of multiple myeloma is unknown, however, there are some known risk
                                    factors for multiple myeloma that increases one’s risk of developing the condition.
                                    These include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Age over 65 years</li>
                                    <li>Being male</li>
                                    <li>Having a family history of myeloma</li>
                                    <li>Being obese</li>
                                    <li>Having other plasma cell neoplasms such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
                                        significance (MGUS) or solitary plasmacytoma</li>
                                    <li>Exposure to ionizing radiation, asbestos, benzene, pesticides, etc</li>
                                    <li>Being infected with HIV or human herpesvirus 8</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Multiple Myeloma Symptoms and Signs</h3>
                                <p>Multiple myeloma develops slowly, and the symptoms may not appear until later stages.
                                    The symptoms, when they occur may vary depending on the tumor location and the type
                                    of blood cells affected. These may include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Bone pain, especially in your spine, hips, or chest</li>
                                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                                    <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                                    <li>Constipation</li>
                                    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                                    <li>Unintentional weight loss</li>
                                    <li>Confusion or mental fogginess or confusion</li>
                                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                                    <li>Recurrent infections or illnesses</li>
                                    <li>Frequent urination</li>
                                    <li>Weakness and numbness in legs</li>
                                    <li>Excessive thirst</li>

                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>In many cases, multiple myeloma could be detected accidentally during routine blood
                                    or urine tests. In other cases, when any sign and symptom suggest multiple myeloma,
                                    the following tests or procedures may be used to confirm the diagnosis.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Blood tests:</b> Blood tests are used to identify the blood cell counts, calcium
                                    and uric acid levels, M proteins, or other abnormal proteins like
                                    beta-2-microglobulin. Blood viscosity may be measured, as the blood may turn too
                                    thick due to the accumulation of excess protein. Measuring the levels of lactic
                                    dehydrogenase (LDH) may also help to evaluate the prognosis of the condition; high
                                    levels of LDH indicate advanced disease with a poor prognosis.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Urine tests:</b> Urine samples are analyzed for the presence of M proteins that
                                    are referred to as Bence Jones proteins when detected in urine. However, routine
                                    urinalysis may not indicate the presence of Bence Jones proteinuria. Hence a 24-hour
                                    urinalysis (a sample of urine that has been collected over 24 hours), urine protein
                                    electrophoresis (UPEP), and urine immunofixation may be required.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Bone marrow aspiration:</b> During a bone marrow aspiration, a bone marrow sample
                                    is obtained using a long needle inserted into the bone. The sample is sent for
                                    laboratory analysis to check for the presence of myeloma cells. Specialized
                                    molecular tests such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be used to
                                    detect genetic abnormalities related to multiple myeloma.  </p><br>
                                <p><b>Imaging tests:</b> The following imaging tests can be used to reveal bone problems
                                    associated with multiple myeloma and to determine the extent of cancer spread.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Bone X-rays:</b> Damage to the bones caused by myeloma cells can be detected
                                        using X-rays. A series of X-rays known as bone survey or skeletal survey to
                                        include the majority of the bones (skull, spine, arms, ribs, hips, and thighs)
                                        is performed to reveal the presence of any bone destruction.</li>
                                    <li><b>Computed Tomography (CT) Scan:</b> A CT scan provides detailed
                                        cross-sectional images of the bones or organs using X-rays, and can help detect
                                        the bone damage due to myeloma. It may also be used to guide the biopsy needle
                                        to obtain tissue samples from the suspicious area.</li>
                                    <li><b>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):</b> MRI uses radio waves to obtain detailed
                                        images of the soft tissues and bones in the body, which can reveal abnormalities
                                        in the bone marrow. MRI can also reveal plasmacytoma that cannot be seen using
                                        regular X-rays.</li>
                                    <li><b>Positron emission tomography (PET):</b> A PET scan is performed by injecting
                                        a radioactive tracer into the body, which is mainly absorbed by the cancer
                                        cells. A special camera is used to create a picture of the areas of
                                        radioactivity in the body. A PET scan is often combined with a CT scan to
                                        provide more detailed and accurate information about cancer. Like an MRI, a PET
                                        scan can help detect plasmacytomas that cannot be seen on regular x-rays.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Stages of multiple myeloma</h3>
                                <p>The information obtained from the diagnostic tests is used to analyze the extent of
                                    the cancer spread. This process is known as staging. It helps to understand the
                                    outlook of the condition and work up the treatment plan.</p><br>
                                <p>The staging of multiple myeloma is based on the measurement of serum albumin and the
                                    levels of serum beta-2-microglobulin (β2-M).</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Stage I:</b> Serum beta-2 microglobulin is less than 3.5 mg/L with serum
                                        albumin of 3.5 g/dL or more</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage II:</b> Serum beta-2 microglobulin between 3.5 mg/L and 5.5 mg/L and
                                        serum albumin less than 3.5 g/dL</li>
                                    <li><b>Stage III:</b> Serum beta-2 microglobulin greater than 5.5 mg/L</li>

                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Treatment for multiple myeloma predominantly involves managing the symptoms such as
                                    pain, controlling complications, and slowing down the progression of the condition.
                                    Many treatment options are available for multiple myeloma, which are selected based
                                    on the extent of the condition and how it affects your body.</p><br>
                                <p>The standard treatments options for multiple myeloma include:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Targeted therapy:</b> Targeted therapy is rather a primary therapy used to treat
                                    all stages of multiple myeloma. The drugs in this class known as proteasome
                                    inhibitors block the action of proteasomes, which are substances that break down old
                                    proteins, eliminate them and replace them with new ones. This causes the
                                    accumulation of large amounts of protein leading to the death of cancer cells.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Immunomodulatory drugs:</b> Immunotherapy drugs are used in the standard treatment
                                    of multiple myeloma. They act by strengthening the immune cells to fight against
                                    cancer cells and preventing the growth signals of the cancer cells, thereby directly
                                    killing the myeloma cells.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Corticosteroids:</b> Corticosteroids are used to treat all the stages of multiple
                                    myeloma. They can help control inflammation and can also kill multiple myeloma cells
                                    when used in high doses. They may also help to reduce nausea and vomiting associated
                                    with chemotherapy and other treatments.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Monoclonal antibodies:</b> Monoclonal antibodies are specifically designed to
                                    target specific proteins present in the myeloma cells, thereby killing them.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs that act on fast-growing
                                    cells, thus affecting the cancer cells and killing them. These drugs can affect the
                                    normal cells and hence chemo drugs are given in cycles, which allows the normal
                                    cells to recover from the damage. In the treatment of multiple myeloma, drugs are
                                    frequently used in high doses before a bone marrow transplant. Chemotherapy drugs
                                    are usually given in combination.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b> Radiation therapy involves using high-energy beams (X-rays
                                    or protons) to damage cancer cells and prevent their growth. It is used to treat
                                    specific cases of multiple myeloma or to reduce its complications. High doses of
                                    radiation along with chemotherapy may be used in the treatment of plasmacytomas,
                                    whereas, low doses may be used to relieve symptoms such as pain or to prevent bone
                                    fractures and spinal cord compression.</p><br>
                                <h3>Stem cell transplant</h3>
                                <p>Stem cell transplant is commonly used to treat multiple myeloma. Initially, high-dose
                                    chemotherapy is used to kill the affected cells in bone marrow followed by infusing
                                    the healthy stem cells into the body, which travel to the bones and rebuild the bone
                                    marrow. When the patient receives his stem cells it is known as an autologous stem
                                    cell transplant. When the stem cells are obtained from the donor, it is called an
                                    allogeneic stem cell transplant.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                                <p>Although many factors may affect the prognosis of multiple myeloma, it can be
                                    well-managed. The five-year relative survival for multiple myeloma is about 60%. The
                                    survival rate for multiple myeloma is improving, which can be attributed to the
                                    continuous research towards the development of new drugs and their approval.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/ovariancancer.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Ovarian cancer is one of the common female reproductive cancers. It is the seventh
                                    most diagnosed cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated female
                                    mortality in the world. According to the latest report of the National Cancer
                                    Registry Program (NCRP), ovarian cancers rank third after uterine and
                                    cervical cancers in Indian women. Even though ovarian cancer has a lower prevalence
                                    in comparison to breast cancer, it has the worst prognosis and is three times more
                                    fatal than breast cancer.</p><br>
                                <h3>About ovarian cancer</h3>
                                <p>Ovaries are a pair of oval-shaped female reproductive organs that produce and release
                                    eggs (ovum) for reproduction. It is responsible for the production of female
                                    hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone.</p><br>
                                <p>Ovarian cancer is a disease caused by abnormal growth and division of cells in the
                                    ovary. Previously, ovarian cancers are believed to begin only in the ovaries, but
                                    recent studies showed that ovarian cancer can also begin in the part of the
                                    fallopian tube near an ovary and spread to the surface of the ovaries and beyond.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>Types of ovarian cancer:</h3>
                                <p>Ovaries are made of three kinds of cells and each type of these cells can develop
                                    into a different type of ovary tumor:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b> Epithelial cell tumors:</b> Begin in the cells that cover the outer surface
                                        of the ovary and fallopian tubes, and account for 85 to 90 percent of ovarian
                                        cancers</li>
                                    <li> <b>Germ cell tumors:</b> Begin in the egg-producing cells and occur rarely</li>
                                    <li> <b>Stromal cell tumors:</b> Begin in the stroma, the tissue that holds the
                                        ovary together and surrounds the egg</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Ovarian Cancer Symptoms and Signs</h3>
                                <p>Ovarian cancers are often referred to as “silent killers” as there are no
                                    reliable signs and symptoms in the early stages of this disease. Most of the
                                    early symptoms of ovarian cancer are similar to that of other conditions, such
                                    as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, if ovarian cancers cause symptoms,
                                    it includes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Bloating</li>
                                    <li>Pelvic or abdominal pain</li>
                                    <li>Trouble eating or feeling full quickly</li>
                                    <li>Urinary urgency</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Advanced stage symptoms include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Changes in bowel habits</li>
                                    <li>Pain during intercourse</li>
                                    <li>Lower back pain</li>
                                    <li>Unintentional weight loss or weight gain</li>
                                    <li>Abdominal swelling/ascites</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Ovarian Cancer Risk Factors and Causes </h3>
                                <p>Cancers usually develop when some abnormal cells in the ovary begin to multiply
                                    at an uncontrollable rate creating a mass of abnormal cells. Some of these
                                    tumors are benign (non-cancerous), while others may be malignant (cancerous).   
                                </p><br>
                                <p>The following factors may increase the risk of ovarian cancer:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Older age</li>
                                    <li>A family history of ovarian cancer</li>
                                    <li>A personal history of breast, uterine, or colon cancer</li>
                                    <li>Use of hormone therapy after menopause</li>
                                    <li>Never having a full-term pregnancy</li>
                                    <li>Endometriosis, a condition where a tissue that normally lines the uterus is
                                        found outside the uterus</li>
                                    <li>Obesity</li>
                                    <li>Smoking</li>
                                    <li>Exposure to asbestos</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Initially, the signs and symptoms, medical history, and family history of the
                                    patient are reviewed. If something suspicious is found, a pelvic examination is
                                    done. In addition to the complete pelvic examination, the following tests are
                                    often recommended to detect ovarian cancers:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <b>TVUS (transvaginal ultrasound):</b> It uses sound waves to locate a
                                        tumor in the ovary, and can give a clear idea of the size of the mass, as
                                        well as determine if it is a simple ovarian cyst, a complex cyst, or a solid
                                        tumor.</li>
                                    <li> <b>CA-125 blood test:</b> It is a type of blood test that measures the
                                        amount of CA-125 protein in the blood. High levels of CA-125 usually
                                        indicate ovarian cancer.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>However, for an accurate ovarian cancer diagnosis, the following tests are
                                    recommended.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Imaging tests:</b> Tests such as a pelvic computerized tomography (CT)
                                        scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are recommended to examine
                                        the structures of the ovary. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan and
                                        chest x-ray can be done to determine whether ovarian cancer has spread to
                                        other parts of the body, such as the lungs.</li>
                                    <li><b>Laparoscopy:</b> A laparoscope (a thin flexible tube with a mounted video
                                        camera) is passed into the pelvic region to view the ovaries and other
                                        pelvic organs. Also, surgical tools may be used to collect a sample tissue
                                        for biopsy.</li>
                                    <li><b>Biopsy:</b> A biopsy involves removing a tissue sample and examining it
                                        in the laboratory.</li>
                                    <li><b>Blood test:</b> A sample of blood is collected to determine the organ
                                        function and overall health of the person.</li>
                                </ul><br>

                                    <li> <b>Oophorectomy:</b> It involves the removal of one or both ovaries. If
                                        both the ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed, it is called a
                                        bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. It is usually recommended for germ cell
                                        tumors and stromal tumors that have not spread outside the ovary capsule
                                        (thick connective tissue layer).</li>
                                    <li> Cytoreduction/ Debulking surgery: It is recommended when ovarian cancer has
                                        spread throughout the abdomen at the time of surgery. The main aim of this
                                        procedure is to completely remove the visible cancers larger than 1 cm. A
                                        debulking surgery involves removing a part of the small intestine, spleen,
                                        gallbladder, as well as a part of the stomach, liver, and pancreas.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Hysterectomy:</b> It involves the surgical removal of the uterus,
                                        cervix, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and surrounding tissues if the tumor has
                                        spread beyond the uterus.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Lymphadenectomy:</b> It involves the surgical removal of the lymph nodes
                                        when cancer has spread through the lymph system.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> It involves using drugs to destroy rapidly growing cancer
                                    cells in the body. These drugs interfere with the process of cell division and
                                    promote cancer cell death. For ovarian cancer, chemotherapy is administered as
                                    an initial treatment for more advanced ovarian cancer that cannot be removed
                                    surgically.</p><br>
                                <p>Chemo drugs are injected into a vein (IV) or given orally. In some cases, it is
                                    inserted directly into the abdominal cavity called intraperitoneal (IP)
                                    chemotherapy.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b> It involves delivering high-energy beams to destroy
                                    cancer cells. It is usually recommended for advanced-stage ovarian cancer.
                                    Radiation therapy is mostly combined with chemotherapy for effective results.
                                    For ovarian cancers, radiation therapy is given either externally by using an
                                    external machine or internally by placing a radioactive substance near the
                                    tumor.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Targeted therapy:</b> Targeted therapy involves the use of specific drugs to
                                    identify and destroy cancer without causing much damage to the normal cells.  It
                                    is recommended to prevent ovarian cancer recurrence or tumors that resist other
                                    treatments. </p><br>
                                <p><b>Hormone therapy:</b> This therapy involves the use of hormones or
                                    hormone-blocking drugs to fight cancer. It mostly helps treat the stromal cell
                                    tumors.  </p><br>
                                <h3>Prevention:</h3>
                                <p>There is no known way to prevent ovarian cancers. However, research has shown
                                    that the following factors may help in the prevention of ovarian cancer:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Taking birth control pills</li>
                                    <li>Longer breastfeeding</li>
                                    <li>Full-term pregnancies</li>
                                    <li>Undergoing surgical procedures like hysterectomy or a tubal ligation</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Outlook:</h3>
                                <p>The outlook generally depends on the type of cancer and the stage of cancer at
                                    diagnosis and individual factors, such as age, overall health, and how your body
                                    responds to the treatment. The survival rate is more than 90% when the cancer is
                                    diagnosed in its early stages.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/skincancer.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Skin cancer is the most diagnosed malignancy across the world. Though most cases are
                                    preventable, skin cancer can greatly affect the quality of life, and can even cause
                                    death. The yearly incidence of skin cancer is higher than that of all other cancers
                                    combined. In India, skin cancers account for about 1-2% of all diagnosed cancers.
                                    Exposure to direct sunlight is related to the risk of the development of skin
                                    cancers. Despite awareness and screening measures, the increased rates of skin
                                    cancer raise concerns for both patients and the healthcare system. </p><br>
                                <h3>About skin cancer</h3>
                                <p>The skin is the largest organ in the body. It has a discrete structure and is made up
                                    of mainly three layers: epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. The skin primarily acts
                                    as a physical and biological barrier against irritants, allergens, and the external
                                    environment. Additionally, it prevents the loss of water and helps maintain internal
                                    homeostasis.</p><br>
                                <p>Skin cancer occurs when the normal skin cells undergo mutations (changes) in their
                                    DNA and begin to grow out of control. These abnormal changes in the cells may
                                    initially lead to a pre-cancerous stage.  In some cases, these pre-cancers cells
                                    turn into invasive cancers that can spread to other parts of the body and can be
                                    fatal.</p><br>
                                <h3>Types of skin cancer</h3>
                                <p>The main types of skin cancers are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Basal cell carcinoma:</b> It accounts for 80 percent of skin cancers. This
                                        cancer begins in the basal cell lining that lies beneath the squamous layer.
                                        They usually grow slowly and rarely spread to other parts of the body.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Squamous cell carcinoma:</b> It accounts for 20 percent of all skin cancers.
                                        This cancer begins in the squamous cells that make up the middle and outer
                                        layers of the skin. They often develop in the sun-exposed areas such as the
                                        ears, face, scalp, neck, and hands. They grow rapidly and spread to other parts
                                        of the body.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Melanoma:</b> It develops from melanocytes, the skin cells that produce
                                        melanin pigment, which gives skin its color. They resemble moles and can be
                                        found on any area of the body, even in areas that are not typically exposed to
                                        the sun.</li>
                                    <li> <b>Merkel cell cancer:</b> It is rare, aggressive skin cancer. It develops in
                                        the hormone-producing cells just beneath the skin and in the hair follicles.
                                        Merkel cancers usually appear as firm, painless lesions, or nodules on
                                        sun-exposed areas.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Abnormal changes or lesions in the skin are the warning signs of skin cancers.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The signs and symptoms of each type of skin cancer are usually different, such as:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Squamous cell carcinomas may produce a wart-like and scaly skin lesion with a
                                        depression (ulcer) in the center. </li>
                                    <li> Basal cell carcinomas may produce white, or flesh-colored, dome-like lumps with
                                        a waxy appearance.</li>
                                    <li> Melanomas often include a new or existing mole that has irregular borders or
                                        elevation that changes in size, shape, color, or appearance.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Causes/Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>Though the exact cause of skin cancer is not clear, the ultraviolet (UV) radiation
                                    found in sunlight and the lights used in tanning beds is found to increase the risk
                                    of skin cancer. Intense exposure and cumulative, long-term exposure to UV radiation
                                    may damage the skin cells leading to cancer.</p><br>
                                <p>Factors that might increase the risk of skin cancer include the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> A family history of skin cancer</li>
                                    <li> A personal history of skin cancer</li>
                                    <li> Weakened immune system</li>
                                    <li> Intense exposure to radiations</li>
                                    <li> Fair skin</li>
                                    <li> Precancerous skin lesions</li>
                                    <li> A history of sunburns or fragile skin</li>
                                    <li> A Large number of moles</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Skin Cancer Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Initially, the signs and symptoms, medical history, and family history of the patient
                                    are reviewed. Based on the appearance of the skin lesion, a biopsy of the suspicious
                                    skin area may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Biopsy:</b> A sample of tissue is collected from the suspected area and is
                                    examined under the microscope to determine any abnormalities. A biopsy can be done
                                    in one of the several ways, including:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Shave biopsy is often recommended when a basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
                                        is suspected. The procedure involves shaving off a piece of the lesion by
                                        numbing that area.</li>
                                    <li> Excisional biopsy is usually recommended when melanoma is suspected. The
                                        procedure involves numbing the entire suspected and surrounding tissue and
                                        removing the entire tumor for analysis.</li>
                                    <li> Incisional biopsy is similar to an excisional biopsy, but during the procedure,
                                        only a portion of the tumor is removed for laboratory analysis.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>When skin cancer is confirmed through biopsy, other imaging tests like computerized
                                    tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans may be recommended to
                                    determine whether the skin cancer has spread to other body parts.</p><br>
                                <h3>Stages of skin cancer</h3>
                                <p>Basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas rarely spread to other parts of the body. The
                                    melanoma staging is done using the TNM staging system. It provides detailed
                                    information about:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Tumour (T):</b> Whether the primary tumor is located and how thick or deep
                                        is the original tumor</li>
                                    <li><b> Node (N):</b> Whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes surrounding the
                                        tumor</li>
                                    <li><b> Metastasis (M):</b> Whether cancer has spread to distant parts of the body
                                    </li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>The staging for skin cancer includes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Stage 0a/0is:</b> Tumors are located only in the top layers of the skin and

                                    <li><b> Stage I:</b> Tumors are either smaller than 0.8mm and are not ulcerated or
                                        between 1 and 2 mm in thickness but not ulcerated.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage II:</b> Tumors are either between 1 to 4 mm in thickness and ulcerated
                                        and/or more than 4 millimeters in thickness but not ulcerated or greater than 4
                                        millimeters thick and are ulcerated.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage III:</b> Tumor may be of any thickness and may or may not be
                                        ulcerated, but the tumor has spread to nearby lymph nodes</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage IV:</b> The tumor can be any size and has spread through the
                                        bloodstream to other parts of the body like the lungs, liver, or bones.</li>

                                <h3>Skin Cancer Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Based on the type of skin cancer, its stage, size, and location, the patient can be
                                    treated with the following treatment modalities: </p><br>
                                <p>Surgery: It is the mainstay of treatment for both melanoma and non-melanoma skin
                                    cancers. Depending upon the type, size, and stage of cancer, any of the following
                                    surgeries may be recommended:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Cryosurgery:</b> It is a type of ablation to destroy the cancerous cervical
                                        tissues at cold temperatures. During the procedure, a liquid nitrogen probe is
                                        placed directly on the tumor cells to freeze and destroy the growth on the
                                        surface of the skin. It is an effective treatment for precancerous skin lesions
                                        (for actinic keratosis treatment).</li>
                                    <li><b> Mohs micrographic surgery:</b> It is an effective method for removing basal
                                        and squamous cell carcinomas. During the procedure, the tumor growth is removed
                                        layer by layer, and examined under the microscope, until no cancer cells remain.
                                        This procedure involves removing the cancerous cells while preserving the
                                        healthy surrounding tissues.</li>
                                    <li><b> Excisional surgery:</b> It is the main melanoma cure, and involves the
                                        removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy skin and soft tissues. The
                                        extent of the surgery depends on the size and thickness of the tumor.</li>
                                    <li><b> Curettage and electrodesiccation:</b> It is usually recommended for very
                                        small basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. The procedure involves the
                                        removal of the skin lesion with a curette, which is a sharp, spoon-shaped
                                        instrument. It is followed by treating the area with an electric current to
                                        control bleeding and destroy the remaining cancer cells.</li>
                                    <li><b> Sentinel lymph node biopsy:</b> It is recommended for advanced-stage cancers
                                        that have spread to the lymph nodes. The procedure involves identifying the
                                        affected lymph nodes and removing the entire suspected area and surrounding
                                        tissues.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p><b>Radiation therapy:</b> It involves the use of high-energy X-ray beams to kill
                                    cancer cells. It is usually recommended for advanced-stage skin cancers and for
                                    tumors that cannot be completely removed during surgery. For skin cancers, radiation
                                    therapy is given either externally by using an external machine or internally by
                                    placing a radioactive substance near the tumor.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Chemotherapy:</b> It involves the use of potent drugs to destroy rapidly growing
                                    cancer cells in the body. These drugs interfere with the process of cell division
                                    and promote cancer cell death. In cancers that are limited to the top layer of skin,
                                    these drugs are applied topically (directly to the skin). For advanced cancers,
                                    chemo drugs are injected into a vein (IV).</p><br>
                                <p><b>Targeted therapy:</b> Targeted therapy involves the use of specific drugs to
                                    identify and destroy skin cancer without causing much damage to the normal
                                    cells. These drugs are used to treat melanoma and some non-melanoma skin cancers,
                                    and also in rare cases of advanced basal cell carcinoma treatment.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Immunotherapy:</b> It involves the use of certain medicines to boost a person’s
                                    immune system to find and destroy the cancer cells. Checkpoint inhibitors and
                                    cytokines are two classes of immunotherapy drugs that are used to treat some cases
                                    of Merkel cell carcinoma and melanoma.</p><br>
                                <h3>Preventive measures</h3>
                                <p>Even though, there is no proven way to completely prevent skin cancers, managing some
                                    risk factors may help in lowering the risk of the disease.</p>
                                 <p>Follow these steps to prevent skin cancer:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Get regular skin cancer screenings.</li>
                                    <li> Wear sunscreen.</li>
                                    <li> Avoid tanning beds.</li>
                                    <li> Limit or avoid direct exposure to the sun during the middle of the day.</li>
                                    <li> Wear sun-protective clothing.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Outlook</h3>
                                <p>When detected and treated early, non-melanoma skin cancers can have a survival rate
                                    above 95 percent. These cancers can be completely removed by surgery. The prognosis
                                    of malignant melanoma depends on the thickness of the tumor at the time of
                                    treatment. The survival rate decreases for advanced-stage skin cancers, when cancer
                                    has metastasized to other areas of the body.</p>

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/thyroidcancer.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Thyroid cancer is estimated to be the 7th most common type of cancer among females
                                    and the 14th most common cancer among males. In India, the incidence rate of thyroid
                                    cancer in females is 1%–5%, and in males is 2%.</p><br>
                                <p>The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located in the lower front of the
                                    neck, just below Adam’s apple. The thyroid gland controls the body’s metabolism by
                                    releasing hormones that regulate several functions in the body, such as utilizing
                                    energy, producing heat, consuming oxygen, regulating heart rate, blood pressure,
                                    etc.</p><br>
                                <h3>About thyroid cancer</h3>
                                <p>Thyroid cancer occurs when there is a sudden change or a mutation in the cells,
                                    causing the abnormal cells to form. These abnormal cells multiply in the thyroid
                                    gland to form a tumor. If the cancer is diagnosed early, it can be treated
                                    successfully.</p><br>
                                <p>The incidence of thyroid cancer appears to be increasing. Experts believe that this
                                    can be attributed to the advancements in technology that allow the identification of
                                    small thyroid cancers, which may not have been found in the past.</p><br>
                                <p>There are various types of thyroid cancers; some are aggressive, while some grow very
                                    slowly. However, most can be cured with treatment.</p><br>
                                <h3>Types of thyroid cancer</h3>
                                <p>Thyroid cancers can be classified into the following types based on the type of cells
                                    found in the tumor.</p><br>
                                <p>Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common type. It develops from the follicular
                                    cells (produce and store thyroid hormones), usually only in one lobe of the gland.
                                    Cancer tends to grow very slowly but usually spreads to the lymph nodes in the neck.
                                    This type of cancer is common among 30 to 50-year-old people, but it can occur at
                                    any age.</p><br>
                                <p>Follicular thyroid cancer is the next most common type, which usually occurs in
                                    regions where people do not consume enough iodine in their diet. It also arises from
                                    thyroid follicular cell carcinoma. This type of cancer rarely spreads to the lymph
                                    nodes in the neck, but often spreads to the bones or lungs. It is common among
                                    individuals who are more than 50 years old.</p><br>
                                <p>Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma is a rare type of thyroid
                                    cancer that develops from the follicular cells. It usually spreads quickly to the
                                    neck lymph nodes and other parts of the body, and hence is very difficult to treat.
                                    This type of cancer typically occurs in a 60-year-old individual or older.</p><br>
                                <p>Medullary thyroid cancer begins in the C cells of the thyroid gland (which produce
                                    calcitonin hormone). An elevated level of calcitonin can suggest this cancer at the
                                    initial stages. This type of cancer is difficult to find, and it can spread to the
                                    lymph nodes, lungs, or liver before being discovered.</p><br>
                                <p>Other rare types of thyroid cancer include thyroid sarcoma, which starts in the
                                    connective tissue cells of the thyroid, and thyroid lymphoma, which begins in the
                                    immune system cells of the thyroid.</p><br>
                                <h3>Causes/ Risk factors</h3>
                                <p>The exact cause of thyroid cancer is not clear.</p><br>
                                <p> When the thyroid cells undergo genetic changes or mutations, the cells lose the
                                    ability to die like normal cells, thus they grow and multiply rapidly. These
                                    abnormal cells accumulate to form a tumor and can spread to the surrounding tissues
                                    and organs (metastasize).</p><br>
                                <p>Certain factors can increase the risk of thyroid cancer; these include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Female sex</li>
                                    <li> Exposure to radiation</li>
                                    <li> Some genetic syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasias</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
                                <p>Typically, there are no observations for thyroid cancer early symptoms. As cancer
                                    grows, it may cause the following symptoms:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> A lump (nodule) in the neck</li>
                                    <li> Difficulty swallowing</li>
                                    <li> Trouble breathing</li>
                                    <li> Changes in the voice, including hoarseness</li>
                                    <li> Pain when swallowing</li>
                                    <li> Swollen lymph nodes in the neck </li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                <p>Tests that can detect and diagnose thyroid cancer include:</p><br>
                                <p><b> Physical exam:</b> The patient’s neck is checked for any swelling or lumps. The
                                    patient may be asked if they were exposed to radiation recently or if they have a
                                    history of thyroid tumors.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Blood tests:</b> Blood samples may be analyzed to evaluate the functioning of the
                                    thyroid gland.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Ultrasound imaging:</b> An ultrasound of the lower neck may be performed to check
                                    for any nodules and if they are noncancerous (benign) or cancerous.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Fine-needle aspiration biopsy:</b> A thin long needle is inserted through the
                                    skin, precisely into the thyroid nodule, with the help of ultrasound imaging.
                                    Thereafter, a sample of the suspicious thyroid tissue is removed using a needle,
                                    which is analyzed for cancer cells in the laboratory.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Other imaging tests:</b> One or more imaging tests may be performed to help the
                                    doctor determine if cancer has spread beyond the thyroid gland. These tests may
                                    include MRI, CT, and nuclear imaging tests.</p><br>
                                <h3>Staging of thyroid cancer</h3>
                                <p>Thyroid cancer is staged using the TNM staging system. This provides details about:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Tumor (T):</b> Size and location</li>
                                    <li><b> Node (N):</b> Number and location of the tumor spread to the lymph nodes (if
                                        any)</li>
                                    <li><b> Metastasis (M):</b> Size and location of cancer spread to other parts of the
                                        body (if any)</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Based on this system, thyroid cancer has the following stages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Stage I:</b> Small tumor with or without spread to lymph nodes.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage II:</b> A larger localized tumor, with or without spread to lymph
                                        nodes.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage III:</b> Tumor >4 cm confined to the thyroid, but may have minimally
                                        spread outside the thyroid.</li>
                                    <li><b> Stage IV:</b> This stage is classified into three more substages based on
                                        whether the tumor has spread to nearby structures, the lymph nodes, or distant
                                        organs.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Most types of thyroid cancers can be treated successfully. The treatment options for
                                    thyroid cancer depend on the type, stage, overall health, and preferences of the
                                    patient.</p><br>
                                <p>Some of the treatment options for thyroid cancer have been discussed below:</p><br>
                                <h3>Surgery</h3>
                                <p>Surgery is a common treatment method for thyroid cancer. One of the following
                                    surgical procedures may be used:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b> Thyroidectomy:</b> All of the thyroid tissue (total thyroidectomy) or most
                                            of the thyroid tissue (near-total thyroidectomy) may be removed.</li>
                                    <li><b> Thyroid lobectomy:</b> Half of the thyroid is removed in this procedure. The
                                        lymph nodes near cancer may also be removed.</li>
                                    <li><b> Lymph node dissection:</b> The lymph nodes in the neck may be removed during
                                        thyroidectomy in this procedure.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Radiation therapy</h3>
                                <p>Radiation therapy involves directing high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation
                                    to the cancer cells to kill or prevent them from growing. The two types of radiation
                                    therapy used to treat thyroid cancer include:</p><br>
                                <p><b>External radiation therapy:</b> In this method, a machine aims high-energy beams
                                    toward cancer from outside the body.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid cancer:</b> In this method, large doses
                                    of radioactive iodine in a capsule or a liquid are given. This iodine is absorbed by
                                    the thyroid cells first, and later by the thyroid cancer cells; hence, there is a
                                    low chance of affecting other cells in the body.</p><br>
                                <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
                                <p>Chemotherapy involves the usage of drugs to kill cancer cells. These drugs travel
                                    throughout the body and kill rapidly growing cells. Chemotherapy is sometimes
                                    recommended for anaplastic thyroid cancer treatment.</p><br>
                                <h3>Targeted drug therapy</h3>
                                <p>Targeted drug therapy involves giving drugs that target the signals of cell growth
                                    and division of thyroid cells. These drugs may include certain tyrosine and protein
                                    kinase inhibitors.</p><br>
                                <h3>Thyroid hormone therapy</h3>
                                <p>In this treatment method, patients are given thyroid hormone medication
                                    levothyroxine, usually for those who underwent thyroid cancer treatment, such as
                                    thyroidectomy. The thyroid cancer treatment kills the thyroid cells and hence is not
                                    able to produce sufficient amounts of thyroid hormone. Levothyroxine supplies the
                                    missing hormone. This medication also inhibits the pituitary gland from producing
                                    thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). High TSH levels can induce any remaining cancer
                                    cells to grow.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                                <p>Most individuals with thyroid cancer have no known risk factors. Hence, there is no
                                    definite way of preventing thyroid cancer.</p><br>
                                <p>However, here are some measures that may prevent thyroid cancer:</p><br>
                                <p><b>Avoid getting exposed to radiation:</b> Radiation should not be used to treat less
                                    serious diseases. Imaging tests like X-rays and CT scans must not be performed,
                                    particularly in children, unless they are needed.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Take medicine:</b> For individuals who live near nuclear power plants, or in case
                                    of a nuclear reactor accident, a medication that blocks the effects of radiation is
                                    provided. This medication must be taken only if recommended by a doctor. </p><br>
                                <p><b>Get tested:</b> Individuals who have a family history of medullary thyroid cancer
                                    can undergo genetic tests to look for gene mutations. If a person is at risk of
                                    thyroid cancer, the thyroid gland can be removed, and thyroid cancer can be
                                    prevented. A genetic counselor can give a clear picture of the risk of thyroid
                                    cancer.</p><br>
                                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                                <p>Most cases of thyroid cancer are treated completely. Follicular and papillary
                                    carcinoma treatment includes complete removal of the thyroid gland lobe that harbors
                                    cancer. The thyroid gland is completely removed when the gland has a nodule within
                                    it or has multiple other nodules on both sides, or when cancer has spread to lymph
                                    nodes in the neck. Expert evaluation, timely diagnosis, and treatment by the best
                                    suitable method can result in the best outcomes for the patient.</p>
