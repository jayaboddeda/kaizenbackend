                                        <h2>ABOUT CANCER</h2>
                                       <p> Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. Over 100 types of cancer are prevalent which are different in behavior and response to treatment. Globally, cancer is the second leading cause of death and accounts for 9.6 million deaths in 2018.</p><br>
                                       <p>One of the most significant challenges of the 21st century in the world today is to understand the burden of growing cancer patients and ways to prevent it. It is first important to understand cancer to manage it effectively.</p><br>
                                       <p>Humans are complex multicellular organisms made up of trillions of cells, each with its structure and function. And our body is programmed to routinely replenish cells in different organs. As normal cells age or get damaged, they die off and new cells take their place as per the signals given by the genes.</p><br>
                                       <p>Cancer begins when these genetic changes interfere with this orderly process. When this process is disturbed, cells no longer respond to the signals and begin to grow abnormally. These abnormal cells grow and divide uncontrollably in the body and slowly accumulate to form a tissue mass, lump or growth called a tumor. These abnormal cells can destroy normal body tissue and spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system.</p><br>
                                        <h3>Types of Cancer</h3>
                                        <p> Cancers are mainly divided into five types based on where it begins:</p>
                                           <ul> <li> Carcinomas develop in the skin or tissues that line the internal organs</li>
                                            <li> Sarcomas begin in the bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, or other connective tissues</li>
                                            <li> Leukemia begins in the blood cells and bone marrow</li>
                                            <li> Lymphomas begin in the lymphatic system</li>
                                            <li> Central nervous system cancers develop in the brain and spinal cord</li></ul><br>
                                        <h3>Causes of Cancer</h3>
                                        <p>Uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation because of the genetic changes are the basic cause of cancer. Few cancers are due to inherited genetic mutations but most cancers are related to environmental, lifestyle, or behavioral exposures.</p><br>
                                        <h3>The usual causes of cancer are:</h3>
                                            <ul><li> Genetic factors: There are over 50 identifiable hereditary forms of cancer. Hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect called cancer syndromes.</li>
                                            <li> Physical and chemical agents: Cancer-causing substances are called carcinogens. Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke.</li>
                                            <li> Lifestyle factors: Many lifestyle factors such as diet, obesity, and alcohol increase the risk of cancer.</li>
                                            <li> Infection & inflammation: An approximate 18% of worldwide cancer cases are related to infectious diseases. There is evidence that inflammation itself plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer.</li>
                                            <li> Hormonal factors: Cell proliferation is promoted by some hormones which play a key role in the development of cancer.</li>
                                            <li> Radiation: Of all invasive cancers, up to 1% account for radiation exposure, which includes both non-ionizing radiation and ionizing radiation.</li></ul><br>
                                        <h3>Signs & Symptoms of Cancer:</h3>
                                        <p>Signs and symptoms caused by cancer may vary depending on the type of cancer, its location, and its spread to other organs or tissues.</p><br>
                                        <p>Some general signs and symptoms associated with cancer include:</p>
                                            <ul><li> Unexplained weight loss</li>
                                            <li> Fatigue</li>
                                            <li> Lump or area of thickening that can be felt under the skin</li>
                                            <li> Skin changes, such as yellowing, darkening, or redness of the skin, itching, sores that won't heal, or changes to existing moles</li>
                                            <li> Changes in bowel or bladder habits</li>
                                            <li> Breathing trouble</li>
                                            <li> Difficulty swallowing</li>
                                            <li> Persistent cough or hoarseness</li>
                                            <li> Neurological problems like headache, blurred vision, seizures</li>
                                            <li> Persistent, unexplained muscle or joint pain</li>
                                            <li> Fevers or night sweats</li>
                                            <li> Unexplained bleeding or bruising</li></ul><br>
                                        <h3>Myths about Cancer debunked:</h3>
                                        <p>Here are the facts behind some of the most common cancer myths:</p><br>
                                        <p>Myth 1: All cancers are the same and can be treated the same way</p><br>
                                        <p>Fact: All cancers and their treatments are not the same and they do not affect every patient in the same way. In general, a patient receives treatment based on the location of the cancer, whether or how much it has spread, how it is affecting the body functions and the overall health of the patient.</p><br>
                                        <p>Myth 2: Cancer is contagious</p><br>
                                        <p>Fact: Cancer is not contagious. Spending time with a loved one who has cancer will not cause you to get it too.</p><br>
                                        <p>Though cancer does not spread from person to person, certain viruses or bacteria can increase your risk of getting cancer. Certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been known to cause cervical, anal, and some kinds of cancers. Hepatitis B or C spreads through sexual intercourse or infected needles can increase your risk of getting liver cancer.</p><br>
                                        <p>Myth 3: Biopsy makes cancer spread</p><br>
                                        <p>Fact: This is a dangerous misconception. There is no appropriate scientific evidence to support this notion. Biopsy benefits the patient in several ways by making accurate staging and relevant treatment planning possible.</p><br>
                                        <p>Myth 4: Eating sugar makes cancer worse</p><br>
                                        <p>Fact: Although research has shown that cancer cells consume more glucose (sugar) than normal cells, no studies have shown that eating sugar will make your cancer worse or less sugar intake slows down cancer development.</p><br>
                                        <p>Myth 5: Cancer is a death sentence</p><br>
                                        <p>Fact: Even though cancer mortality rates are high, about a third of all cancers can be cured if they are detected and treated early. With a healthy lifestyle, treatment, and regular health check-ups, one can survive for at least five years after the cancer is diagnosed.</p><br>
                                        <p> Myth 6: No family history of cancer means you are not at risk</p><br>
                                        <p>Fact: Although having a family history of cancer increases your risk of developing the disease, only 5% to 10% of cancer cases are caused by inherited genetic mutations. The remaining 90% to 95% of cases are caused by the individual's lifestyle and environment, such as smoking or exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, etc.</p><br>
                                        <p>Myth 7: Superfoods prevent cancer</p><br>
                                        <p>Fact: While a healthy diet can help improve the way you feel, there is no single food or food group that can provide enough protection against cancer. Some foods like blueberries, beetroot, broccoli, garlic, and green tea are rich in antioxidants that help to remove toxic elements from the body.</p><br>
                                        <p>Even though cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases, early detection, and specific treatment protocol lead to a success rate of 60-90%. In general, the survival rate and success of treatment for cancer depend on the stage of cancer during diagnosis and the overall health of the patient. Regular screening and health checks would help in early detection. The recent advances in cancer treatment are geared toward positive outcomes.</p><br>

                                        <h3>1. Surgery</h3>
                                        <p>Surgical oncologists perform cancer surgeries to remove the tumor or some
                                            nearby tissues. Depending upon the purpose of the surgery, the following are
                                            some of the types of surgery used in cancer treatment:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li> <b>Curative Surgery:</b> When the cancerous tumor growth is more
                                                localized in the body, this type is performed to remove it from that
                                                specific area.</li>
                                            <li> <b>Preventive Surgery:</b> Though the nearby tissue of the cancerous
                                                cells isn’t affected, it will be removed to prevent the malignancy of
                                                the tumor-affected cells.</li>
                                            <li> <b>Diagnostic Surgery:</b> To rule out or conclude, if the specific
                                                tissues are cancerous or not, the tissue sample is removed for
                                                examination in the pathological lab. This helps in the diagnosis and
                                                detection of cancer type or stage.</li>
                                            <li> <b>Staging Surgery:</b> This type of surgery is performed to know to
                                                what extent cancer has affected the body. Laparoscopy is one of the
                                                tools to perform Staging surgery.</li>
                                            <li> <b>Debulking Surgery:</b> This type of surgery removes a part of the
                                                tumor, so as not to damage the affected organ.</li>
                                        </ul><br>
                                        <p>Other types include palliative, supportive, and restorative surgeries.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>Apart from Open or Minimally invasive surgeries, other surgeries are
                                            performed through less invasive techniques. Few among them include:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li> <b>Robotic Surgery:</b> Robotic arms are used to perform precise
                                                surgeries by controlling surgical equipment. One robot arm has a
                                                laparoscope. Other arms hold tiny surgical instruments that can fit into
                                                an incision less than an inch long. The surgeon sits at a screen that
                                                provides 3-dimensional views of the tumor. A joystick similar to that of
                                                a video game precisely controls each robotic arm, which mimics the
                                                motions of the wrist and hand, providing dexterity.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>The robotic device used in surgery are known for having greater dexterity and

                                        <h3>2. Radiation Therapy</h3>
                                        <p>High doses of radiation are used in this treatment procedure to kill cancer
                                            cells or shrink tumors. Cancer cell DNA is damaged by using high doses of
                                            radiation that kill cancer cells or slow down their growth. Thus, the
                                            damaged DNA of cancer cells stops dividing or dies. These damaged cells,
                                            when they die are removed from the body. There are two main types of
                                            radiation therapy, external beam and internal.</p><br>
                                        <p><b>External-beam Radiation Therapy:</b> It is the most common type of
                                            radiation therapy. It delivers radiation from a machine outside the body. It
                                            can treat large areas of the body if needed. A machine called a linear
                                            accelerator, or linac creates the radiation beam for x-ray or photon
                                            radiation therapy. Special computer software adjusts the beam’s size and
                                            shape. This helps target the tumor while avoiding healthy tissue near the
                                            cancer cells.</p><br>
                                        <p><b>Internal Radiation Therapy:</b> Internal radiation therapy is also called
                                            brachytherapy. This type of radiation therapy is when radioactive material
                                            is placed into cancer or surrounding tissue. Implants may be permanent or
                                            temporary and may require a hospital stay.</p><br>

                                        <h3> 3. Chemotherapy</h3>
                                        <p>Cancer cells are killed using drugs in chemotherapy type of treatment. There
                                            are more than 100 drugs that are used as a part of Chemotherapy, and each of
                                            them works in its unique way. But one thing is very clear, these drugs stop
                                            the cancer cells from growing.</p><br>
                                        <p>Chemotherapy is given intravenously. They are also given as a pill, a shot, a

                                        <p>Cancers arising from organs such as breasts and prostate, use hormones to
                                            grow. Thus, hormone therapy slows down the growth or stops it. Hormone
                                            therapy is used to:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li> Treat cancer. Hormone therapy can lessen the chance that cancer will
                                                return or stop or slow its growth.</li>
                                            <li> Ease cancer symptoms. Hormone therapy may be used to reduce or prevent
                                                symptoms in men with prostate cancer who are not able to

                                        <p><b>Types of hormone therapy:</b> Hormone therapy falls into two broad groups,
                                            those that block the body’s ability to produce hormones and those that
                                            interfere with how hormones behave in the body.</p><br>
                                        <h3>5. Targeted Therapy</h3>
                                        <p>This type of treatment targets specific cells by helping inhibition of cancer
                                            growth, division, or spread. Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment
                                            that uses drugs designed to "target" cancer cells without affecting normal
                                            cells. </p><br>
                                        <p>Cancer cells typically have changes in their genes that make them different
                                            from normal cells. Genes are part of a cell's DNA that tell the cell to do
                                            certain things. When a cell has certain gene changes, it doesn't behave like
                                            a normal cell. For example, gene changes in cancer cells might allow the
                                            cell to grow and divide very quickly. These types of changes are what make
                                            it a cancer cell.</p><br>

                                                it. Examples: alemtuzumab (certain chronic leukemias), trastuzumab

                                                neck cancers). NOTE: Some monoclonal antibodies are referred to as
                                                targeted therapy because they have a specific target on a cancer cell
                                                that they aim to find, attach to, and attack. But other monoclonal
                                                antibodies act like immunotherapy because they make the immune system

                                        <p>This type of treatment allows our immune system to fight cancer during which
                                            immunity is boosted. In a healthy human being, the immune system prevents
                                            the growth of various kinds of cancer by finding and destroying abnormal
                                            cells. For example – The cells of the immune system are found inside or
                                            around tumors in the body which means that the immune system is affecting
                                            the tumor. These immune system cells are called TILs or Tumor-infiltrating
                                            lymphocytes. People whose tumors have these cells do better than those

                                        <p>Isotope means two or more forms of the same element that contain equal
                                            numbers of protons but different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei, and
                                            hence relative atomic mass is different than that of chemical properties.
                                            Especially, an element in a radioactive form. Radioisotopes of a particular
                                            atom contain an unstable combination of neutrons and protons, which may lead
                                            to excess energy (and instability). Medical Isotopes or Radionuclides are
                                            radiologically active atoms.</p><br>
                                        <p>Medical Radionuclides can fall into three major categories. The first is
                                            diagnostic, where the radioisotope allows doctors to visualize a tumor’s
                                            precise location and contours within the body with greater clarity than an
                                            MRI scan provides. Another is therapeutic, where doctors use radionuclides
                                            to deliver cancer-killing radiation directly to tumor cells. The third is
                                            theragnostic, which combines the power of both in such a way that the
                                            theragnostic radionuclide agent allows a doctor to both visualize and treat
                                            a tumor simultaneously.</p><br>

                                        <p>Cancer treatments, depending on the usage are of 4 types:</p><br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li> <b>Primary Treatment:</b> The goal of a primary treatment is to
                                                completely remove cancer from your body or kill all the cancer cells.
                                            </li>
                                            <li> <b>Adjuvant Treatment:</b> The goal of adjuvant therapy is to kill any
                                                cancer cells that may remain after primary treatment to reduce the
                                                chance that cancer will recur.</li>
                                            <li> <b>Palliative Treatment:</b> Palliative treatments may help relieve
                                                side effects of treatment or signs and symptoms caused by cancer itself.
                                            </li>
                                            <li> <b>Supportive Care:</b> Supportive care in cancer is the prevention and
                                                management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. This
                                                includes management of physical and psychological symptoms and side
                                                effects across the continuum of the cancer experience from diagnosis,
                                                through anticancer treatment, to post-treatment care. Enhancing
                                                rehabilitation, secondary cancer prevention, survivorship, and
                                                end-of-life care are all integral to Supportive Care.</li>

                                        <h2>Fighting Cancer</h2>
                                        <p>The only thing constant in this universe for a human is the “Struggle”. The
                                            struggle while being born, the struggle while growing up, the struggle to
                                            lead a happy life, and the struggle to achieve your goals. Everyone’s life
                                            has at least a little struggle involved in his/her life. </p><br>
                                        <p>Holistically, it’s the struggle for survival is the LIFE in itself. Hence,
                                            being a patient of cancer is only part of a greater struggle we are dealing
                                            with. Therefore, a patient, who is fighting cancer is experiencing Life as a
                                            whole and is willing to struggle through the obstacles to reach their bigger
                                            goals.</p><br>
                                        <p>Though cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, every year,
                                            millions of people are diagnosed with cancer, and still almost half of the
                                            patients eventually survive. </p><br>
                                        <p>As a potentially life-threatening disease, it is also a condition that is
                                            associated with significant fears and concerns. As a result, a diagnosis of
                                            cancer can have a profound effect on the individual and their family
                                            member’s health and well-being. The patient can experience a rollercoaster
                                            of emotions like anxiety, distress, and depression. Though it is normal to
                                            feel these emotions after being diagnosed with cancer, at the same time, it
                                            is important to recognize these changes and get help when needed.</p><br>
                                        <p>Surviving cancer is always the goal, but the real test for the cancer patient
                                            is how to deal with it?</p><br>
                                        <h3>1. Going through the fight</h3>
                                        <p>During the initial days of diagnosis, the patient can experience physical,
                                            social, emotional, and psychological changes. Life after a cancer diagnosis
                                            depends on how you think it to be. Your perception will become reality. Try
                                            to choose the brighter side and avoid judging yourself for your emotions.
                                        </p><br>
                                        <p>The first step in fighting cancer is realizing that you have an issue and
                                            having the courage to reach out for help.</p> <br>
                                        <p>Once you have been diagnosed with cancer, it is important to know the details
                                            of your condition. Have an open discussion with your doctor and collect
                                            basic and useful information about the diagnosis such as cancer location,
                                            whether it has spread to other parts, available treatment options, the
                                            success rate of each treatment, and the possible side effects.</p><br>
                                        <p>It is always advisable to seek a second opinion about your condition. This
                                            will help you feel confident and comfortable in the diagnosis and treatment
                                            plans. Talking to another doctor will also help you in clearing your doubts
                                            and provide you with peace of mind.</p><br>
                                        <p>Getting ready for the treatment schedule and coping with its side effects is
                                            the next task. Dealing with cancer treatment may make you physically and
                                            emotionally draining. Yet, it is manageable. It is important to prepare
                                            yourselves physically and mentally before undergoing the procedure. As the
                                            journey continues, these treatments can cause your body to change. Your body
                                            may look different and most patients struggle with these changes and the
                                            effects they have on self-esteem. Try to accept these changes as part of
                                            your cancer journey.</p><br>
                                        <p>If you suffer from a prolonged sense of mixed emotions and adjustment issues
                                            seek help from a psychotherapist, healthcare team, and support group or
                                            faith community.</p><br>
                                        <h3>2. Fighting childhood Cancer</h3>
                                        <p>Studies showed that every two minutes, a child somewhere in the world is
                                            diagnosed with cancer. When cancer is diagnosed in a child, it not only
                                            affects that child but also affects the whole family. A parent is never
                                            prepared to hear that their child is diagnosed with such a life-threatening
                                            illness. The parents have to handle their emotions and will have to make
                                            tough decisions about the treatment plan and should also learn about the
                                            medical procedures and clinical visits.</p><br>
                                        <p>The treatment plan for childhood cancers should be designed to help kids to
                                            navigate the challenges that come during their cancer journey. Several
                                            hospital visits and treatment schedules may affect your child’s health and
                                            make them feel more anxious and fatigued. Seek help from a certified child
                                            life therapist to prepare your child for the cancer journey. There are also
                                            several advocacy groups worldwide that support cancer patients and their
                                            family with adequate and timely assistance. Regular follow-up and healthy
                                            eating habits will increase your child’s chances of the best possible
                                            outcome.</p><br>
                                        <h3>3. Coping with Cancer</h3>
                                        <p>After the initial shock and depression, it is important to learn about what
                                            comes next and how to deal with it. Being diagnosed with cancer is “Not The
                                            End”. You have to move on.</p><br>
                                        <p>Here are some strategies to deal with the stress and emotional challenges
                                            that come from a cancer diagnosis:</p><br>
                                        <h3>1. Find emotional support</h3>
                                        <p>It is quite natural to feel lonely after a cancer diagnosis. You have to
                                            understand that fighting cancer is a team effort. Share your thoughts and
                                            feelings with your loved ones and family. It will give you the strength to
                                            cope with the situation. There are also several advocacy groups worldwide
                                            that support people with various types of cancers.</p><br>
                                        <h3>2. Prepare yourself for the possible physical changes</h3>
                                        <p>It is necessary to have a better understanding of the consequences of the
                                            treatment before undergoing it. Have a discussion with your doctor about the
                                            changes you should expect and prepare accordingly. Based on the instructions
                                            provided by your healthcare team, prepare yourself well so that you will be
                                            able to handle the changes in a better way.</p><br>
                                        <h3>3. Take care of yourselves</h3>
                                        <p>You have to be physically and emotionally healthy to take care of your family
                                            and their mental health. Here are some ways to take care of your mental
                                            health:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Try to get a good amount of sleep each night</li>
                                            <li>Take a break by revisiting your favourite hobbies</li>
                                            <li>Choose a healthy diet consisting of a variety of healthy foods.</li>
                                            <li>Practice relaxation techniques and stress relief exercises to reduce
                                                stress and anxiety.</li>
                                            <li>Create a support system by contacting your friends or family members
                                            </li>
                                        </ul> <br>
                                        <p>A positive attitude is important to fight cancer, but the greatest predictor
                                            of surviving cancer is the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis and the
                                            overall health of the patient. Find out the best doctor and healthcare team
                                            who is specialized in cancer care and can design a perfect treatment plan.

                                       <p> Doubts are normal, especially when it comes to something serious as cancer. A cancer diagnosis is not just serious but is a life-changing condition. So, exploring a second opinion is a smarter decision to empower yourself about the condition and current treatment options. A decent consultant will never get offended by a second opinion. Instead, the primary physician may sometimes initiate the process of a second opinion by referring the patient to an expert. According to studies, about one in eight patients is misdiagnosed with cancer.  </p><br>
                                       <p> Cancer patients have a wide range of emotions and rush into any treatment plan blindly. Mostly, with a new cancer diagnosis, there is always a time gap depending on the type and stage of cancer. During this period, the patient can always plan for getting a second opinion.</p><br>
                                       <p>Making self-aware of the underlying condition, and aiding it with a second opinion on the prognosis of the disease is a sign of empowering the patients.</p>

                                       <p> Hi, I am Shiva, I am a 22-year-old. Until a few months ago, a was living quite happily with my family and friends. All the trouble started when I began working out in a gym. Over time, I noticed a swelling in my right forearm. It was not troublesome, so I didn't pay much attention to it. Then, this COVID pandemic started, and we moved to our village. There, my grandfather noticed the swelling on my forearm, and he took me to a local registered medical practitioner. I guess he was not much aware of what the swelling was, and he bandaged my arm, but that, unfortunately, resulted in rashes and itching. Every person had different advice and remedy to suggest, I even tried herbal medicines, but nothing seemed to help.</p><br>
                                       <p>Slowly, I started to notice that my fingers were not functioning that well and were weak. I then went to a hospital and got an x-ray done. The X-ray showed that I was suffering from a condition called Ewing's sarcoma. At that time, I didn't even know what it meant. Later, I was advised to undergo some tests, we were in and out of hospitals for tests and time seemed to fly by.</p><br>                                        
                                       <p>I was going through a lot of pain and was (still am) very scared about what was going on with me. Once, I almost had a near-death experience in the MRI room. The MRI machine looked very scary and was frightened by all the chaos going around me. I was pretty clueless about what was happening, and was uncertain if would make it? Following the MRI, biopsies were performed and still, my future was uncertain.</p><br>                                        
                                       <p>I remember it was my birthday. I woke up to a television ad that spoke of a 7-year-old cancer patient with Ewing’s sarcoma. It disturbed me to the core. I had random thoughts of my death, but I didn’t want to die. I was so young to die, I had so many things to be done and accomplished. With all these things running in my mind, I rushed to my orthopedic surgeon to get my doubts cleared. The orthopedic specialist assured me about my survival, but I had to undergo amputation, that was a big shocker!</p><br>                                        
                                       <p>Later, I was referred to Dr. Sudha Sinha who suggested a PET CT scan. When I went for the scan, chills ran down my spine on seeing the PET scan machine. It looked like the same MRI machine and I was very scared, but to my surprise, it went well. I had to pass through the machine not once but twice!! Based on my test results, I was advised to undergo chemotherapy. I had heard many rumors about chemotherapy, that it is more painful than the disease itself, and so I was terrified to take chemotherapy. Despite everything I heard and read on the internet, I prepared myself for this battle. Thanks to Dr. Sudha who gave me a lot of positivity and motivated me to do this.</p><br>                                        
                                       <p>Although I was skeptical about the treatment initially due to my past experiences with other treatments, the results after the very first cycle were good. I started noticing changes, both in terms of the return of function of my fingers, and the side effects. I am now empowered with great courage, now undoubtedly, I feel "I can and I will beat this cancer".</p><br>                                        
                                       <p>There is another cycle of chemotherapy following which I would be ready for surgery. With this whole exercise, I've come to understand my true potential and my inner spirit to fight cancer. If I can Do It, I am sure, You can do it too!</p>
