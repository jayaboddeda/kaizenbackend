                                    <h2>ABOUT CANCER</h2>
                                    <p>Cancer is a generic term used to describe a group of diseases that develop across
                                        time and can affect any part of the body. There are more than a hundred distinct
                                        types of cancer, which vary substantially in their behavior and response to
                                        treatment. Globally, cancer is the second leading cause of death and accounts
                                        for
                                        9.6 million deaths in 2018.</p>
                                    <p>As the cancer burden continues to grow globally, the prevention of cancer is one
                                        of
                                        the most significant challenges of the 21st century. To understand any cancer
                                        type
                                        and to manage it effectively, it is first important to understand about cancer.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5 class="orange-text">What is cancer?</h5>
                                    <p>Humans are complex multicellular organisms made up of trillions of cells, each
                                        with
                                        its own structure and function. And our body is programmed to routinely
                                        replenish
                                        cells in different organs. As normal cells age or get damaged, they die off and
                                        new
                                        cells take their place as per the signals given by the genes.</p>
                                    <p>Cancer begins when these genetic changes interfere with this orderly process.
                                        When
                                        this process is disturbed cells no longer respond to the signals and begin to
                                        grow
                                        abnormally. These abnormal cells grow and divide uncontrollably in the body and
                                        slowly accumulate to form a tissue mass, lump or growth called a tumor. These
                                        abnormal cells can destroy normal body tissue and spread through the bloodstream
                                        and
                                        lymphatic system.</p>

                                    <p>Cancer is a generic term used to describe a group of diseases that develop across
                                        time and can affect any part of the body. There are more than a hundred distinct
                                        types of cancer, which vary substantially in their behavior and response to
                                        treatment. Globally, cancer is the second leading cause of death and accounts
                                        for
                                        9.6 million deaths in 2018.</p>
                                    <h5 class="orange-text">What is cancer?</h5>
                                    <p>Humans are complex multicellular organisms made up of trillions of cells, each
                                        with
                                        its own structure and function. And our body is programmed to routinely
                                        replenish
                                        cells in different organs. As normal cells age or get damaged, they die off and
                                        new
                                        cells take their place as per the signals given by the genes.</p>
                                    <p>Cancer begins when these genetic changes interfere with this orderly process.
                                        When
                                        this process is disturbed cells no longer respond to the signals and begin to
                                        grow
                                        abnormally. These abnormal cells grow and divide uncontrollably in the body and
                                        slowly accumulate to form a tissue mass, lump or growth called a tumor. These
                                        abnormal cells can destroy normal body tissue and spread through the bloodstream
                                        and
                                        lymphatic system.</p>

                                        its own structure and function. And our body is programmed to routinely
                                        replenish
                                        cells in different organs. As normal cells age or get damaged, they die off and

                                        cells take their place as per the signals given by the genes.</p>

                                        slowly accumulate to form a tissue mass, lump or growth called a tumor. These

                                        treatment. Globally, cancer is the second leading cause of death and accounts
                                        for
                                        9.6 million deaths in 2018.</p>
