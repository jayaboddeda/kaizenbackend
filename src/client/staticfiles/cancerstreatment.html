                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/chemotherapy.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>Naturally, the idea of Chemotherapy will give you mixed feelings. Your goal is to
                                    beat cancer but you might be nervous thinking of the after-effects of Chemotherapy.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>There is something you should know here. Chemotherapy has helped a lot of people beat
                                    cancer for the past 70 years, which tells us that it has a long track record of
                                    success. Modern drugs of Chemotherapy are far more effective and have very few side
                                    effects.</p><br>
                                <h3>Chemotherapy/Chemo</h3>
                                <p>There are more than 100 drugs that are used as a part of Chemotherapy, and each of
                                    them works in its unique way. But one thing is very clear, these drugs stop the
                                    cancer cells from growing.</p><br>
                                <p>Usually, chemotherapy is given intravenously. They are also given as a pill, a shot,
                                    a skin cream, or a liquid that you can swallow.</p><br>
                                <p>The type of Chemotherapy given to you depends on certain factors like</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> The kind of cancer you have</li>
                                    <li> The size of your tumor</li>
                                    <li> Whether it has spread</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Sometimes, you may receive more than one chemotherapy drug at a time, because a
                                    certain combination of drugs kills more cancer cells. This is termed Combination
                                    Chemotherapy.</p><br>
                                <h3>Benefits</h3>
                                <p>Chemotherapy has many benefits.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Prevent the spread of cancer</li>
                                    <li> Slowing down the growth of cancer cells</li>
                                    <li> Destroying cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body</li>
                                    <li> Reduce other problems and pain due to the tumor</li>
                                    <li> Completely cure your cancer</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>What to Expect</h3>
                                <p>Kaizen Oncology team will make sure that you understand the complete procedure
                                    before, during, and after Chemotherapy.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Healthy cells are also destroyed along with cancer cells because Chemotherapy
                                        drugs cannot differentiate between cells. You might have side effects like</li>
                                    <li> Fatigue </li>
                                    <li> Nausea or vomiting </li>
                                    <li> Hair loss </li>
                                    <li> Anemia </li>
                                    <li> Memory problems</li>
                                    <li> You are also at high risk of infections.</li>
                                    <li> Women should keep away from becoming pregnant because Chemotherapy can
                                        harmfully affect the fetus.</li>
                                    <li> Chemotherapy can also result in infertility in men and women. If you are
                                        thinking about having children, speak to our doctors who will recommend options.

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/cancersurgey.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p> Among many ongoing treatments for Cancer, “surgery” is one of the oldest and most
                                    effective treatments. Surgical oncologists perform cancer surgeries to remove the
                                    tumor or some nearby tissues.</p><br>
                                <p> Depending upon the purpose of the surgery, the following are some of the types of
                                    surgery used in cancer treatment:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Curative Surgery: When the cancerous tumor growth is more localized in the
                                        body, this type is performed to remove it from that specific area.</li>
                                    <li> Preventive Surgery: Though the nearby tissue of the cancerous cells isn’t
                                        affected, it will be removed to prevent the malignancy of the tumor-affected
                                        cells.</li>
                                    <li> Diagnostic Surgery: To rule out or conclude, if the specific tissues are
                                        cancerous or not, the tissue sample is removed for examination in the
                                        pathological lab. This helps in the diagnosis and detection of cancer type or
                                        stage.</li>
                                    <li> Staging Surgery: This type of surgery is performed to know to what extent
                                        cancer has affected the body. Laparoscopy is one of the tools to perform Staging
                                        surgery.</li>
                                    <li> Debulking Surgery: This type of surgery removes a part of the tumor, so as not
                                        to damage the affected organ.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Other types include palliative, supportive, and restorative surgeries.</p>
                                <p>Apart from Open or Minimally invasive surgeries, other surgeries are performed
                                    through less invasive techniques. Few among them include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Laser Surgery: Lasers are used in précised surgical removal of the cancerous
                                        tissue instead of a blade or a scalpel. It is also used to burn and vaporize
                                        tumors or precancerous tumors.</li>
                                    <li> Cryo-Surgery: A chemical liquid that is very cold and freezing, such as liquid
                                        nitrogen spray is used in the precancerous treatment or to kill abnormal cells.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> Electro Surgery: To destroy affected cells, an electric current with a high
                                        frequency is used.</li>
                                    <li> Robotic Surgery: Robotic arms are used to perform precise surgeries by
                                        controlling surgical equipment.</li>
                                    <li> Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgeries: Both procedures include a thin
                                        flexible camera to be incised into the skin or chest region to undergo the
                                        surgeries which are deep-rooted. These help to decrease blood loss during
                                        surgery and pain after the surgery.</li>

                                <h3>What to Expect Before and After Surgery?</h3>
                                <h3>Before Surgery: </h3>
                                <p>There may be some series of procedures to be followed before the surgery. Most
                                    commonly, blood tests, ECG, and chest x-ray will be performed.</p><br>
                                <p>Prior instructions would be given on when to stop eating or drinking which must be
                                    followed.</p><br>
                                <p>A few of the important questions you may ask would be:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Which tissue is being removed?</li>
                                    <li> How long will the surgery last?</li>
                                    <li> Any possible complications from the surgery?</li>
                                    <li> Post-surgery, should I be staying in the hospital, or can go? If staying, then
                                        how long?</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>After Surgery:</h3>
                                <p>Once the surgery is over, the nurse will instruct you on how to take care of
                                    yourself. She/He may explain to you the following or you may ask for the
                                    clarification:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> How the pain can be controlled?</li>
                                    <li> How to spot an infected wound and how to dress it or take care of it?</li>
                                    <li> Activities that are dos and don’ts?</li>
                                    <li> Follow-up dates and probable date of return to work?</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>At Kaizen Oncology, quality care is delivered by understanding the individual’s
                                    medical emergencies and requirements by coordinating along with the other healthcare

                                <h2>Radiation Therapy</h2>
                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/radiationtherapy.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p> Radiation therapy is among the most common and effective treatments for cancer.
                                    Radiation therapy is also called radiotherapy, irradiation, and x-ray therapy.
                                    Usually, radiation therapy is used alone, or with other treatments as well. Other
                                    treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, hormones, or targeted therapy.</p><br>
                                <h3>How does Radiation Therapy work?</h3>
                                <p>Cancer cell DNA is damaged by using high doses of radiation that kill cancer cells or
                                    slow down their growth. Thus, the damaged DNA of cancer cells stops dividing or
                                    dies. These damaged cells, when they die are removed from the body.</p><br>
                                <p>Radiation therapy does not kill cancer cells right away. The treatment may take days
                                    or weeks to damage the DNA so that cells eventually die. Then, cancer cells keep
                                    dying for weeks or months after radiation therapy ends.</p><br>
                                <h3>Types of Radiation Therapy</h3>
                                <p>There are two main types of radiation therapy, external beam and internal.</p><br>
                                <p>Factors that determine the type of radiation therapy:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> The Cancer Type</li>
                                    <li> Tumor Size</li>
                                    <li> Location of the tumor in the body </li>
                                    <li> How close the tumor is to normal tissues that are sensitive to radiation</li>
                                    <li> Your general health and medical history</li>
                                    <li> Whether you will have other types of cancer treatment</li>
                                    <li> Other factors, such as your age and other medical conditions</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>External-beam Radiation Therapy:</h3>
                                <p>It is the most common type of radiation therapy. It delivers radiation from a machine
                                    outside the body. It can treat large areas of the body if needed.</p><br>
                                <p>The types of external-beam radiation therapy are:</p><br>
                                <p>Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT).  3-dimensional detailed
                                    pictures of the cancer are created from Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic
                                    Resonance Imaging (MRI). It often means that they can safely use higher doses of
                                    radiation therapy while reducing damage to healthy tissue. </p><br>
                                <p>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). This is a more complex form of
                                    radiation. With IMRT, the intensity of the radiation is varied within each field
                                    unlike conventional 3D-CRT, which uses the same intensity throughout each beam. IMRT
                                    targets the tumor and avoids healthy tissue better than conventional 3D-CRT.</p><br>
                                <p>Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). This refers to the practice of using daily
                                    images of each treatment field to confirm patient positioning and make sure the
                                    target is in the field. These daily images are compared to the images used to plan
                                    treatment. IGRT allows your doctor to make each treatment field smaller. This allows
                                    better targeting of the tumor and helps reduce damage to healthy tissue.</p><br>
                                <p>Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT). This treatment delivers a large, precise
                                    radiation therapy dose to a small tumor area. The patient must remain very still.
                                    Head frames or individual body molds help limit movement. SRT is often given as a
                                    single treatment or in fewer than 10 treatments. Some patients may need more than
                                    one course of SRT.</p><br>
                                <h3>Internal Radiation Therapy:</h3>
                                <p>Internal radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy. This type of radiation
                                    therapy is when radioactive material is placed into cancer or surrounding tissue.
                                    Implants may be permanent or temporary and may require a hospital stay. Permanent
                                    implants - These are tiny steel seeds that contain radioactive material. The
                                    capsules are about the size of a grain of rice. They deliver most of the radiation
                                    therapy around the implant area. But some radiation may exit the patient’s body.
                                    This requires safety measures to protect others from radiation exposure. Over time,
                                    the implants lose radioactivity. And the inactive seeds remain in the body.</p><br>
                                <p>Temporary internal radiation therapy. This is when radiation therapy is given in one
                                    of these ways:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Needles</li>
                                    <li> Tubes, called catheters, that carry fluid in or out of the body</li>
                                    <li> Special applicators</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>The radiation stays in the body for anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. Most
                                    people receive radiation therapy for just a few minutes. Sometimes, people receive
                                    internal radiation therapy for more time. If so, they stay in a private room to
                                    limit other people's exposure to the radiation</p><br>

                                <p>Questions to ask your doctor about Radiation Therapy</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> What’s the purpose of radiation treatment for my type of cancer? To destroy or

                                <img src="assets/images/cancertypes/bonemarrowtransplant.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <h3>What is a BMT (Bone marrow transplant)</h3>
                                <p>BMT (Bone Marrow Transplant) is a treatment for people who have blood cancers like
                                    Leukemia or Lymphoma, and disorders of the blood like sickle cell disease. </p><br>
                                <h3>The procedure of blood or marrow transplant (BMT)</h3>
                                <p>A BMT is a treatment option where unhealthy blood-forming cells are replaced with
                                    healthy cells. Red blood cells, White blood cells, and Platelets are all
                                    blood-forming cells (Blood Stem Cells). These are found in the soft tissue of the
                                    bone called Bone Marrow. After these cells become mature, they enter the bloodstream
                                    leaving the bone marrow. </p><br>
                                <p>Before a bone marrow transplant, you receive Chemotherapy, or sometimes Radiation
                                    therapy too, so that the diseased cells and Marrow are destroyed. After this,
                                    healthy cells are given to you.</p><br>
                                <p>Though the BMT procedure is complicated and challenging, it doesn’t involve surgery
                                    but begins with the recipient receiving peripheral blood stem cells from the donor.
                                    In another method, Marrow cells are collected from the back of the pelvic bone using
                                    a syringe during which the donor is given general anesthesia.</p><br>
                                <h3>Sources of Healthy Cells</h3>
                                <p>There are 3 sources of getting healthy cells.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> The Spongy tissue inside the bones which is called Bone marrow</li>
                                    <li> The Blood-forming cells from the circulating blood are called Peripheral blood
                                        stem cells/PBSC</li>
                                    <li> The blood collected from the placenta and umbilical cord after a baby is born
                                        is called Cord blood</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Types of BMT</h3>
                                <p>There are 2 types of BMT</p><br>
                                <p>1. <b>Autologous transplant</b> – A process that uses your blood-forming cells.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>2. <b>Allogeneic transplant</b> – A process that uses blood-forming cells that are
                                    donated by
                                    someone else. These cells may come from any one of the below.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> A family member</li>
                                    <li> An unrelated adult donor from a public registry</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Which type of BMT is right</h3>
                                <p>Your BMT doctor will suggest you the right kind of transplant and the sources based
                                    on certain factors like</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Your overall health conditions</li>
                                    <li> The stage of your disease</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Best time for a BMT</h3>
                                <p>A BMT treatment requires time for a lot of planning. So, your doctor will possibly
                                    start the process early. Generally, transplants show success rates if</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Your condition is in the early stages</li>
                                    <li> When you show no symptoms/little disease</li>
                                    <li> Show signs of improvement</li>
                                    <li> Your overall health condition is good</li>
                                </ul><br>
