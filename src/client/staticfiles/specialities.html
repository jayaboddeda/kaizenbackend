                                <img src="assets/images/specialities/immunotherapy.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p> Immunotherapy is a kind of treatment that boosts a person’s immune system to fight
                                    cancer. The immune system is majorly made of white blood cells, tissues, and organs
                                    of the lymph system. In a healthy human being, the immune system prevents the growth
                                    of various kinds of cancer by finding and destroying abnormal cells. For example –
                                    The cells of the immune system are found inside or around tumors in the body which
                                    means that the immune system is affecting the tumor. These immune system cells are
                                    called TILs or Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. People whose tumors have these cells
                                    do better than those compared to who don’t have them. Though our immune system can
                                    destroy slow cancer-growing cells, some cancer cells find ways to avoid this. For
                                    this, the cancer cells might have the below possibilities.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Genetic change that makes the cancer cells less visible to the immune system.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> Develop protein on them that evades the immune system.</li>
                                    <li> Change the healthy cells in and around the tumor which disturbs the immune
                                        system working and response to cancer cells.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <p>Various kinds of immunotherapies are used to treat cancer. </p><br>
                                <h3>Immune checkpoint inhibitors</h3>
                                <p> These are drugs that block immune checkpoints, thereby allowing the cells of the
                                    immune system to respond more strongly and vigorously to cancer.</p><br>
                                <h3>T-cell transfer therapy</h3>
                                <p>This is a therapy that boosts the ability of the T Cells to fight against cancer.
                                    Immune cells, that are active against cancer are taken from your tumor. These are
                                    then grown in large batches and put back into your body through a needle. This
                                    therapy is also called Adoptive cell Therapy, Immune Cell Therapy, or Adoptive
                                    Immunotherapy.</p><br>
                                <h3>Monoclonal antibodies</h3>
                                <p>These are the proteins of the immune system, created and designed in a lab to bind to
                                    certain targets on the cancer cells. Certain monoclonal antibodies mark cancer cells
                                    allowing the immune system to see them better and destroy them. These antibodies are
                                    another type of immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies are also called therapeutic
                                    antibodies.</p><br>
                                <h3>Treatment vaccines</h3>
                                <p>These are vaccines that boost your immune system to act against cancer cells. These
                                    are different from the kind that helps to prevent diseases. Immunotherapy is given
                                    in different ways.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Intravenous (IV) – This is a kind of treatment where immunotherapy goes into
                                        your vein directly.</li>
                                    <li> Oral – This comes in the form of capsules or pills that are to be swallowed.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> Topical – This is a cream that has to be applied on to the skin. (Usually for
                                        skin cancer)</li>
                                    <li> Intravesical – This is a kind where immunotherapy goes into your bladder
                                        directly.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                                <img src="assets/images/specialities/precisionmedicine.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p> Precision medicine is the new medical model which has become very popular in just
                                    over a decade. It is the elaboration of the methodology which believes that one
                                    treatment doesn’t fit all. Therefore, it can be described as customization of
                                    healthcare with tailored medical decisions, treatments, practices, or products by
                                    using the molecular information, phenotypic, and health data from a specific group
                                    of people to establish care insights, and prevent, or treat them in such a way that
                                    their health outcomes are improved.</p><br>
                                <p>In simple, giving the right medicine, to the right patient, at the right time.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Precision medicine sometimes can also be called personalized medicine, is carried out
                                    by understanding the genetic molecular mechanism of diseases, thus helping in
                                    deriving, which treatments work well with which group of patients. It is because of
                                    the observation of patients with the same type of clinical diagnosis or symptoms
                                    responding in different ways to similar treatment.</p><br>
                                <p>Hence, by knowing the patient’s characteristics (biomarkers) and grouping them;
                                    specific types of treatments, therapies, preventive diagnoses, and other health
                                    measures can be generated.</p><br>
                                <p> An individual’s genome is identified and sequenced by Next-Generation Sequencing
                                    (NGS), an important advancement in the clinical applications of precision medicine.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>Doctors, patients, and researchers can use this NGS to identify genetic variants that
                                    help diagnose, treat, and learn more about human diseases.</p><br>
                                <h4>Types of Drugs</h4>
                                <p>There are 2 types of drugs under Targeted Therapy</p><br>
                                <h4>Small molecule drugs </h4>
                                <p>These can enter the cells very easily enabling them to interfere with the inside
                                    molecules. These can also be used against molecules on the cell’s surface. </p><br>
                                <h4>Monoclonal antibodies</h4>
                                <p>These work outside the cancer cells as they are larger. They target those molecules
                                    that are on the surface of the cancer cells. They are designed using cloned cells
                                    which produce antibodies that interfere with the molecules that are targeted. These
                                    are also used to deliver toxic molecules into the cancer cells directly.</p><br>
                                <p>In the future, if there is a complete understanding of the secret behind a patient’s
                                    genetics and its impact on his underlying condition or the likeliness of developing
                                    such condition will be a phenomenal achievement in revolutionizing the approach to
                                    medical practice.</p><br>

                                <img src="assets/images/specialities/vats.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p>VATS (Video assisted thoracoscopic Surgery) is a procedure that is used by the doctor
                                    to examine the inside of your chest cavity and the lungs. This is used to diagnose
                                    and treat health problems inside the chest and the lungs.</p> <br>
                                <p>It is performed with the use of a thoracoscope, which is a narrow, thin tube with a
                                    camera at the end.</p> <br>
                                <h3>When is VATS used?</h3>
                                <p>Below are the reasons for using VATS</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To look into the lungs for diagnosing the source of the issue.</li>
                                    <li>For diagnosing health issues like mesothelioma and lung cancers.</li>
                                    <li>For treating cancers of the lung, esophagus and thymus gland.</li>
                                    <li>For treatment of pleurodesis (Fluid in the lungs)</li>
                                    <li>VATS is also used for repairing hiatal hernia and esophageal disorders.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>VATS is a very good option for people who cannot go for an open chest surgery because
                                    of previous chest surgeries or have other health issues. Your doctor will suggest if
                                    you can go for VATS or not. </p> <br>
                                <h3>Types of VATS</h3>
                                <p>VATS falls under the minimal invasive surgery and involves various types of
                                    procedures.</p> <br>
                                <h3>VATS lobectomy</h3>
                                <p>This is where one of your lobes of the lung is removed through surgery. This is a
                                    common treatment option for non-small cell cancers of the lung.</p> <br>
                                <h3>VATS wedge resection</h3>
                                <p>This is another procedure for patients with lung cancer, where a small, triangle
                                    shaped part of your lung (a Wedge) is removed.</p> <br>
                                <h3>VATS thoracotomy</h3>
                                <p>This is a process where the side of your chest is opened to access the pleural
                                    cavity. This is the space under the chest wall, between your lungs.</p> <br>
                                <h3>VATS procedure for pleural effusion</h3>
                                <p>This VATS procedure (Pleural effusion) is done to remove the fluid build-up from the
                                    pleural cavity.</p> <br>
                                <h3>VATS biopsy</h3>
                                <p>A small amount of tissue is removed from your body and a close examination is done to
                                    find cancer cells. If there are cancer cells, a VATS biopsy is done.</p> <br>
                                <h3>What to expect </h3>
                                <p>Just before the VATS procedure begins, you will be given general anesthesia. You will
                                    be asleep all during the procedure so that you don’t feel pain. A breathing tube is
                                    inserted for you to breathe normally.</p> <br>
                                <p>Your body is positioned to the side helping the surgeon make small cuts near the
                                    ribs, on your chest. Then, the thoracoscope is inserted into these incisions to
                                    enable the surgeon see inside the body to perform the procedure. </p> <br>
                                <p>During the time of recovery, you might take a little more time to feel normal again.
                                    So, it is good that you follow your doctor’s instructions and take enough rest.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>VATS offers fewer complications and faster recovery compared to traditional open
                                    surgery.</p> <br>
                                <h3>Recovery after VATS</h3>
                                <p>It is very common that you will feel sore at the places of incision on your body. But
                                    there is nothing to worry. These incisions are closed with either stitches or
                                    staples, which will be removed by your doctor during your follow-up visits.</p> <br>
                                <p>You will also feel tired for few days. So, follow the after-care instructions and
                                    take medicines regularly.</p> <br>
                                <p>After you start begin to feel normal, you can do some gentle exercises. Stay away
                                    from heavy workouts.</p> <br>
                                <p>If you not feeling well during your recovery, you can always call the care team.</p>

                                    side effects and promote physical and emotional healing.</p><br>
                                <h3>How does Oncoplastic Surgery Work</h3>
                                <p> This treatment is a blend of oncoplastic surgery and Lumpectomy. The surgeon will
                                    remove the tumor, nearby lymph nodes, and a small amount of the surrounding tissue.
                                    Then the bilateral breast reduction or lift is performed towards symmetrical
                                    breasts.</p><br>

                                <h3>Oncoplastic Techniques</h3>
                                <p> Depending on the characteristics of Cancer, there are many oncoplastic techniques.
                                    The most common are listed below.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Local Advancement Flap:</b> Using traditional lumpectomy, doctors remove the tumor
                                    and a little portion of the surrounding tissue. Thereby, depending on the location
                                    and size of the tumor, this will deform the breast. Using a local advancement flap,
                                    surgeons take the tissue that remains after the tumor removal. This is used to
                                    reconstruct the appearance of the normal breast. This ensures that there are no
                                    defects.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Bilateral Breast Reduction:</b> If a lumpectomy is done to one breast, its size
                                    and shape can alter. But bilateral breast reduction is a solution for this as it
                                    alters the shape and size of the other breast too.</p><br>
                                <p>This process involves removing a large amount of tissue from the other breast, which
                                    can be helpful as additional tissue in the case of a large tumor. Modification in
                                    the other breast ensures both breasts look symmetrical.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Bilateral Breast Lift (Mastopexy):</b> This is a kind of minimal bilateral breast
                                    reduction treatment. This is the right option for those who do not want to reduce
                                    their breast sizes. This treatment is also called Mastopexy. Instead of removing
                                    large amounts of tissues from both the breasts, the tissue is removed from the
                                    affected breast and an equal amount from the other one. This will ensure more
                                    symmetrical breasts.</p><br>
                                <p><b>Skin-Sparing Mastectomy:</b> This is a kind of treatment that is necessary for
                                    patients with advanced stages of breast cancer. Skin-sparing Mastectomy helps in
                                    conserving the look of the breast.</p><br>
                                <p>This procedure involves the removal of the skin of the breast, nipple, and areola.
                                    The breast tissue is then taken out, after which the surgeon reconstructs the breast
                                    using the removed skin. This will make sure that the original appearance and shape
                                    are restored.</p><br>

                                <h2>Organ Preservation</h2>
                                <img src="assets/images/specialities/precisionmedicine.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p> At Kaizen Oncology Network, we bring together a multidisciplinary and distinguished
                                    team of physicians, surgeons, and other care professionals to preserve the organs
                                    that are vital for your life or that cannot be easily replaced. There are multiple
                                    organs that can be preserved and the purposes are varied as per the treatment,
                                    surgery, and recommendations from the doctor.</p><br>
                                <p> Techniques for organ preservation serve to minimize the damage of surgery in and
                                    around the targeted area to promote optimal graft survival and function. The main
                                    goal in organ preservation is to maintain the function of the organ and tissue
                                    during storage so that the graft will function at re-perfusion.</p><br>
                                <h3>Breast conservation and reconstruction</h3>
                                <p>This is a surgical procedure that is done to rebuild the shape of the breast. This
                                    procedure is common for women who had undergone surgery for the treatment of breast
                                    cancer. </p><br>
                                <p>Usually, breast cancer surgeries are performed to remove cancer and leave normal
                                    breasts to the most extent possible. But in advanced cancer, the procedure involves
                                    removing all of the breast tissue. These cases require breast reconstruction surgery
                                    to rebuild the appearance and shape of the breast.</p><br>
                                <h3>Sphincter preservation in rectal cancer</h3>
                                <p>Sphincter preservation surgeries are the recommended treatment option for low rectal
                                    cancer which is traditionally treated with abdominoperineal resection (surgery in
                                    which the anus, rectum, and sigmoid colon are removed).</p><br>
                                <p>A sphincter preservation surgery involves complete resection of the tumor by
                                    preserving the continuity of the bowel and functioning of the anal sphincter. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Sphincter preservation surgery is an acceptable alternative to abdominoperineal
                                    resection for low rectal cancer, offering a better quality of life and
                                    sexual-urinary functions, with no increased oncological risk even after 3 years</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Bladder preservation</h3>
                                <p>Bladder preservation is not only very safe but also effective for patients with
                                    muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Surgical removal of a part or complete urinary
                                    bladder requires urinary diversions and substantially weakens the patient’s quality
                                    of life. This procedure is a way of treatment for cancer without affecting the
                                    bladder’s function or form. This approach is usually a combination of three
                                    different treatments.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Radiation therapy</li>
                                    <li> Chemotherapy</li>
                                    <li> Complete TURBT</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Limb salvage/preservation surgeries</h3>
                                <p>Patients living with cancer, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, or a non-healing
                                    wound on the leg, are at a high risk of limb amputation. Latest advances in
                                    limb-sparing surgery have enabled physicians to help you to keep your limb. The
                                    procedure is performed to either remove limb tumors or to manage the wound without
                                    removing the whole limb. At Kaizen Oncology Network, we focus to preserve your
                                    limb(s) while offering you a lifestyle of independence and mobility.</p><br>

                                <h3>What is a BMT (Bone marrow transplant)</h3>
                                <p>BMT (Bone Marrow Transplant) is a treatment for people who have blood cancers like
                                    Leukemia or Lymphoma, and disorders of the blood like sickle cell disease. </p><br>
                                <h3>The procedure of blood or marrow transplant (BMT)</h3>
                                <p>A BMT is a treatment option where unhealthy blood-forming cells are replaced with
                                    healthy cells. Red blood cells, White blood cells, and Platelets are all
                                    blood-forming cells (Blood Stem Cells). These are found in the soft tissue of the
                                    bone called Bone Marrow. After these cells become mature, they enter the bloodstream
                                    leaving the bone marrow. </p><br>
                                <p>Before a bone marrow transplant, you receive Chemotherapy, or sometimes Radiation
                                    therapy too, so that the diseased cells and Marrow are destroyed. After this,
                                    healthy cells are given to you.</p><br>
                                <p>Though the BMT procedure is complicated and challenging, it doesn’t involve surgery
                                    but begins with the recipient receiving peripheral blood stem cells from the donor.
                                    In another method, Marrow cells are collected from the back of the pelvic bone using
                                    a syringe during which the donor is given general anesthesia.</p><br>
                                <h3>Sources of Healthy Cells</h3>
                                <p>There are 3 sources of getting healthy cells.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> The Spongy tissue inside the bones which is called Bone marrow</li>
                                    <li> The Blood-forming cells from the circulating blood are called Peripheral blood
                                        stem cells/PBSC</li>
                                    <li> The blood collected from the placenta and umbilical cord after a baby is born
                                        is called Cord blood</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Types of BMT</h3>
                                <p>There are 2 types of BMT</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Autologous transplant – A process that uses your blood-forming cells.</li>
                                    <li> Allogeneic transplant – A process that uses blood-forming cells that are
                                        donated by someone else. These cells may come from any one of the below.</li>
                                    <li> A family member</li>
                                    <li> An unrelated adult donor from a public registry</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Which type of BMT is right</h3>
                                <p>Your BMT doctor will suggest you the right kind of transplant and the sources based
                                    on certain factors like</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Your overall health conditions</li>
                                    <li> The stage of your disease</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Best time for a BMT</h3>
                                <p>A BMT treatment requires time for a lot of planning. So, your doctor will possibly
                                    start the process early. Generally, transplants show success rates if</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Your condition is in the early stages</li>
                                    <li> When you show no symptoms/little disease</li>
                                    <li> Show signs of improvement</li>
                                    <li> Your overall health condition is good </li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>What diseases can be treated by BMT</h3>
                                <p>More than 70 diseases can be treated by BMT which also include</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Leukemia or Lymphoma</li>

                                <p>IGRT (Image Guided Radiation Therapy) is a treatment procedure which uses imaging
                                    technologies like MRI, PET and CT to safely deliver accurate radiation on cancer
                                    cells. The machine that is used to deliver radiation is called linear accelerator.
                                    These machines are equipped with imaging equipment to enable the doctor to exactly
                                    find the tumor before and while treatment.</p> <br>
                                <h3>Benefits of IGRT</h3>
                                <p>The most commendable benefit of GRT is being very precise, that enables possibilities
                                    like</p> <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>High doses of radiation can be used to kill cancer cells</li>
                                    <li>No harm to the adjacent healthy tissues</li>
                                    <li>Keeping the side effects of radiation to minimum</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>How is IGRT procedure done</h3>
                                <p>At the beginning of every session of treatment, you will be positioned on to a
                                    treatment table. Various scans are conducted to ensure that your body is positioned
                                    right. More scans might also be taken just to ensure that the radiation is delivered
                                    on to the targeted area. IGRT procedure might consume longer time than other types
                                    of radiation treatments.</p> <br>
                                <p>MRI, PET and CT imaging technologies are used during and before IGRT, to make sure
                                    that the treatment is safe and precise. During some IDRT procedures, small dots
                                    (Fiducial Markers) might be placed on your body close to the tumor, for locating the
                                    cancer. </p> <br>
                                <p>These imaging technologies are used to constantly monitor the tumor to check for
                                    growth, shrinkage or any changes in the shape of the tumor.</p> <br>
                                <h3>Frequency of the procedure</h3>
                                <p>You will require multiple sessions of IGRT. Usually, IGRT is done 5 days a week
                                    stretching for several weeks. The total number of treatment sessions depend on
                                    different factors like the type of cancer, its location and size of the tumor.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>When is IGRT recommended?</h3>
                                <p>IGRT is usually used to treat tumors that are located in or close to sensitive organs
                                    in the body. IGRT is apt for those tumors that might move during treatment or
                                    between sessions, like lung tumors. </p> <br>
                                <p>IGRT is generally used to treat lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, spine
                                    cancer, brain cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, bone cancer

                                <h2>Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)</h2>
                                <img src="assets/images/specialities/steriatatcisradiosurgery.jpg" alt=""><br>
                                <p> Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a highly meticulous form of radiation therapy
                                    that was developed to handle small brain tumors and their abnormalities. Though the
                                    name includes “surgery”, it is a minimally invasive non-surgical procedure that
                                    delivers high doses of radiation to the pinpointed targets. Great advancements in
                                    radiation technologies allow the delivery of the pre-decided high doses to the
                                    targeted tissues while minimizing the dosage and effect on surrounding healthy
                                    tissue.</p><br>
                                <p> SRS delivers a methodical, systematic, safe, and minimally invasive treatment option
                                    for patients who are diagnosed with malignant, benign, and specific
                                    dysfunctionalities of the brain and spine including primary and secondary tumors.
                                    SRS can also be effectively deployed for most metastases, meningiomas, schwannomas,
                                    pituitary adenomas, and arteriovenous malformations.</p><br>
                                <h3>Who all are involved in this procedure?</h3>
                                <p>The SRS team is mostly comprised of a radiation oncologist, medical radiation
                                    physicist, radiologist, dosimetrist, radiation therapist, and radiation therapy
                                    nurse.</p><br>
                                <h3>What equipments are used in this procedure?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Gamma Knife: Uses, 190 – 200 beams of highly focussed gamma rays aiming at the
                                        target tissues. Ideal to treat small to medium intracranial lesions.</li>
                                    <li> Linear accelerator (LINAC): This machine uses photons and is ideal for treating
                                        large tumors in a single or multiple sessions. This is also called Fractionated
                                        Stereotactic radiosurgery.</li>
                                    <li> Proton beam or Heavy-charged-particle radiosurgery: As the name suggests, a
                                        proton particle with a heavy charge is used to perform SRS.</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                <h3>Benefits of SRS</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> This technique allows the delivery of radiation with maximum precision onto the
                                        cancer tissues compared to other types of radiation. This also spares the
                                        surrounding tissues from any significant dosage. The intensity of the beam is
                                        controlled by the system ensuring a uniform dosage of radiation.</li>
                                    <li> It is a procedure that avoids the risk of infections, hemorrhage, or
                                        anesthesia, which might otherwise be caused due to surgery. Moreover, it can be
                                        done as an outpatient treatment with very less interruption from other
                                        treatments. The results are also equal to the results of surgery.</li>
                                    <li> This is a single-dose treatment, and so can be replaced with other low dosages
                                        of radiation therapies that require a longer stay.</li>
                                </ul> <br>
                                <h3>Risks</h3>
                                <p>The complaints or side effects are temporary. They are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Fatigue may occur during the first two weeks after the surgery</li>
                                    <li> Swelling is usual at the operated site in the brain and may cause headaches,
                                        nausea, or vomiting. </li>
                                    <li> Scalp and Hair problems include temporary alopecia at the site of treatment due
                                        to irritability of the device during treatment.</li>
                                    <li> Neurological problems may be raised after months of surgery, which is a very
                                        rare late side symptom. </li>
                                </ul><br>
